21-12-2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I applied and received a mortgage with PNC in XX/XX/2017. I was told I HAD to have an escrow account with PNC. My first concern about PNC occurred when I had issues with my house insurance. I had received letters from my insurance company that the insurance payment was due. First I paid the insurance and then I contacted PNC. PNC advised me PNC would sent the payment via regular US mail. The insurance company finally received PNC 's payment. Then the insurance company sent my payment back. I am used to making electronic payments before the due date. I believe PNC should do the same. To me this issue was scary. And it really annoyed me when PNC explained there was a 1 month grace period so I had nothing to worry about. 

My new issue occurred in XXXX and it is how PNC collects my escrow. PNC overcharged me {$1100.00} in escrow and sent me a check. In my opinion, PNC had an interest free loan. Then PNC is going to increase my escrow account. So I contacted PNC and requested that they apply the check to my escrow account which will lower my escrow payment. PNC said no. 

It bothers me that I had to pay my insurance and escrow PNC 's way. PNC 's business model makes gives them an interest free loan. To me there is no incentive to be fair to the mortgagee.",,PNC Bank N.A.,VA,224XX,,Consent provided,Web,21-12-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3107166
24-06-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"XX/XX/2016 I received a letter from Ditech stating my mortgage payment has not been received, thankfully for me I keep very good records and at the time I was paying via money order because I was not going to pay their ridiculous fee of {$12.00} to pay online. I called Ditech and let them know I paid my mortgage and I don't understand what the problem is. They told me I had to go to the business where I purchased the money and get proof which cost me {$24.00} on top of the late fee they were trying to charge me. After so many phone calls and broken promises from the incompetent people that work at Ditech I was able to get the situation taken care of weeks or months later. Come to find out they applied my payment to someone else 's account. The next thing that really broke the camels back was when I received a notice in the mail XX/XX/2016 from Ditech stating they paid my taxes which are not escrowed, we pay out of pocket every year. I called them and told them to take their money off so I could pay my taxes, they refused stating I was delinquent on my taxes. In my County our taxes are not due until XX/XX/XXXX so again Ditech was messing with my account information once again, they stated they inadvertently entered our account and paid our taxes when it should have been another members account. I was promised a letter of resolution and a call to our county treasurer to reverse the payment off so I could pay my taxes. After all this time we are now being sued for the tax payment and being threatened by the collection agency working with these losers. Please do not do business with this incompetent company. Customer service has no clue what is going on and they are extremely rude. Needless to say after the tax incident I went with a credit union in my hometown and have not had one single problem with them. 
One other note : this company has already file bankruptcy twice that I am aware of.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal XXXX portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required XXXX of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting XXXX XXXX  into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the XXXX, FCRA, XXXX PRIVACY RULE, XXXX, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


XXXX ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of XXXX XXXX statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


XXXX ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity XXXX XXXX XXXX that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,117XX,,Consent provided,Web,17-09-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3376646

I reside in XXXX, XXXX and had a scheduled flight from NY to XXXX. I returned to XXXX on XX/XX/2018. Later, I found that the check was not accepted due to ATM/deposit Error. In an effort to resolve the issue, I contacted Chase Bank via phone multiple times. The call center representatives came up with contradictory information every time. The details of my telephonic correspondence with chase is presented in an attached table. 

Finally, I traveled to New York on XX/XX/2018 to resolve this problem. I visited Chase Bank branch in the XXXX and personally met a banker on XX/XX/2018 to get a clearer picture. Even the banker in the branch was unable to help me and was astonished that they are unable to trace the original check. They suggested sending a copy of the check to the address of the party who wrote the check ( address was printed on the check ). I was informed that I shall have to wait 8-days for the check to be delivered to that address in NY. According to the banker, I must have received the copy of the check and updates about the problem much earlier. But even after the passage of around 3-weeks, the fate of this transaction in unknown. 

This ATM error and further mismanagement due to false and contradictory information presented by Chase Bank call centers has caused me a lot of mental and financial distress. I had to put my payments on hold resulting in accrued late payment fines from the creditors as well as loss of trust. It will also negatively impact my credit score. I had to travel to NY at the recommendation of the Chase Call Center representatives and the banker in the Chase Branch. And I am adding to my costs by staying in NY and waiting to receive updates from Chase. I request that either the check be returned to me promptly, or the amount be deposited in my account immediately.

My XXXX credit card was activated XX/XX/XXXX with a limit of {$1200.00} the credit card usage was stopped at approx. {$730.00} for non-payment ( being 3 months in arrears ) in XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately contacted XXXX ( in XXXX XXXX ), knowing I never purchased {$1300.00} worth of merchandise, requesting statements with purchase information for the months of XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX of XXXX but I was told MCM bought my account ( XX/XX/XXXX ) & they no longer had that information but MCM has a Recovery Dept that can send the information I request. I then contacted MCM and MCM 's Recovery Dept. ( XX/XX/XXXX ), requested information for purchases made from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. They sort-of complied, I was mailed XXXX statements "" starting from '' XX/XX/XXXX, INSTEAD, with the beginning balance of {$1300.00} balance leading up to {$1800.00}. I have attached a copy of these statements : XXXX-MCM.pdf ( please be advised that this is not what I asked for ). Needless to say this was not what I requested and oddly the statement showed a previous {$0.00} balance, interest and late fees for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Within the same month ( of XXXX. ) I filed the a dispute with XXXX, requesting MCM to show proof of purchases. I received no reply. I called XXXX XXXX  Consumer Dept ( I'm not sure if that's the right name ) & was suggested to contact XXXX and XXXX ( who owns XXXX accounts ) for a resolve but upon contacting them again I got same answer from both.. "" my account was sold to MCM and they had all the account information '', I'd have to contact MCM. I filed a 2nd dispute In XX/XX/XXXX, with the same request, and in XX/XX/XXXX the 3rd & last dispute was for MCM to show purchases "" prior to '' the {$1300.00} balance, leading up to that balance and accrued fees that total {$1800.00}! XX/XX/XXXX, MCM 's letter reply was ; "" ... we sent the information you requested and we don't understand what you are disputing. Send a letter with your request or contact us. '' Are they playing games? They had not sent what I asked for & numerous times I disputed them requesting time & time again with no resolve! During XXXX credit cards were being breached ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX & XXXX ) and I strongly feel, unless MCM is fibbing about what I owe, at that time I may have been a victim of credit card theft. This is why I'm requesting proof of purchases. It's unfair to charge & make me pay for a thieves debt. In XXXX my XXXX XXXX credit card was breached and used while I was in the store & he checked out the same time I did just one register over!! If the Customer Svc. Department at XXXX XXXX hadn't compared the time & purchase on my receipt to the thief 's, I'd been held liable for that crooks purchase ( s ). 

I have also noticed actions taken by CFPB in XXXX against this company for trying to collect on debts using deceptive tactics. For example : 1-Attempted to collect on unsubstantiated or inaccurate debt : ... ..balances that sellers claimed were approximate or that otherwise did not reflect the correct amount owed by the consumer ... .Some sellers also represented that documents were not available for some of the accounts .... '' 2-XXXX XXXX  Associates falsely claimed an attorney had reviewed the file and a lawsuit was imminent : The companys collectors, who identified themselves as from the Litigation Department, misrepresented to consumers that litigation against them was planned, imminent, or even underway. In reality, in many cases, an attorney had not reviewed the account and the company had not decided whether to file suit. The list goes on and on about these heinous practices and I strongly feel this is happening to me now!! 

Now, early XX/XX/XXXX, I received a FINAL NOTICE ( please see attached FINALMCM.pdf ) from MCM threatening me with lawyers, court and garnishing my wages and bank account ( Example 2 ). I never even received what I asked for and now they're moving forward with actions against me to hurt my livelihood and to damage my credit?

My credit card with Wells Fargo was hacked and {$7000.00} of fraudulent charges were made on it starting in XXXX of 2018. The established pattern of banking consisted of 2-3 transactions per month, simply transferring funds from the credit card to my checking account in large dollar amounts ; typically {$2000.00} to {$3000.00} at a time ; as I managed cash flow. This pattern was in process for approximately 12 months. When the account was hacked, there were suddenly dozens of transactions per day in small dollar amounts made to XXXX and XXXX accounts. 

Wells Fargo failed to notice the unusual account activity and when I discovered the problem and brought it to the attention of their fraud department, they took no responsibility for the problem and refused to reimburse me for the stolen funds. They stated in a letter that since I had paid my bill, that I automatically accept all charges made on the account. This is unacceptable negligence and the poorest customer care I can imagine.

My complaints are the following : 1. Wells Fargo does not seem to have an effective system in place to detect unusual account activity or bank fraud.

2.

Then these same debt buyers that used to be known as collection agencies could re-assign the debt to a fourth party for collection enforcement. This process of stating that debts are being purchased by a third party and then enforced by a fourth party is the larges scam in America. The U. S. Supreme Court decision in XX/XX/2017 known as XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is responsible for this scam. This decision basically states that since a third party purchases the debt, that my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is VOID. The problem is that almost all unsecured debts are sold off to Wall Street in various traunces in securitized trusts. There simply is no resolution where the debt can be purchased, only that the debt can be assigned for collection purposes. Each financial institution must file a 10Q filing quarterly with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The rules on debts being charged off is with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through the FDIC Act, Code 5000. A debt can be classified either standard or sub-standard. Debts over 180 days late must go into the sub-standard category and written off on a quarterly 10Q SEC filing. These charge 0ffs usually are submitted in the tens of millions of dollars. So its virtually for these debts to be sold..period. Accordingly, I request full validation proving the debt purchase. Secondly, I will entertain a very low settlement agreement to put my dispute to rest. All of the settlements can be submitted through the CFPB portal email address submitted.

Most credit card companies, upon being notified, have immediately canceled the card and refunded the fraudulent charges. 

Bank of America, on the other hand, has refused to cancel the charges, claiming since the card was physically present, I am responsible. 

My Bank of America credit card had never been used in the previous 5 years, and yet, upon being used for a number of charges, no fraud alert or notification was sent to me. I personally noticed the charges when I was billed, and immediately notified Bank of America. 

During Bank of America 's investigation they noticed there was another phone number on my account, but they could not identify where that phone number came from. Was it used to activate the stolen card, or did someone else have access to my account? The only thing they claimed was since the card was physically present ( obviously, since it was stolen ), I was liable for those charges, which was a total of {$53.00}. 

As far as I can tell, Bank of America is unable to adequately protect its clients accounts and also unable to adequately investigate fraudulent charges. I have since closed my account, but am looking to get those fraudulent charges dismissed. 

My credit report shows that I normally have thousands of dollars of revolving debt every month, all of which is paid on time.

The loan was transferred to Volvo Car Finance North America. The loan was paid off in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I need to sell or give the boat and trailer to charity and need a clear title to the trailer.The Virginia DMV will not give me a clear title because the title is registered to XXXX. I have called the XXXX number listed on a bill from XX/XX/XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX and have not gotten any results. Volvo will give me a no interest letter, but it does not explain how Volvo obtained the loan and where is XXXX. DMV will not give me a title without that explanation & Volvo refuses to do so. They claim they never heard of XXXX, do n't know how they got the loan ... But we paid our money to XXXX for years, so obviously if we had been in default they would have found a title to sell it with. My last 2 contacts in XX/XX/XXXX have been with a XXXX and a XXXX at the phone number listed on the bill. Every time I call I may get a call center in Tennessee or Nebraska. I spoke to those 2 in Tennessee because the 2 release letters I did get were from the address listed in complaint form. The following is what the VA DMV needs for me to get the title '' Submit evidence to DMV that a lien release can not be obtained from the lienholder due to the lender going out of business, merging with, or being taken over by another business, along with evidence that the lien has been satisfied. Evidence of lien satisfaction may include, but is not limited to the following : For lenders that are merged with, or taken over by another company/corporation/or lender, customer must include a lien release for the vehicle from the company/corporation/or lender with whom merged and supporting documentation linking the original lienholder with the merged or takeover lender. "" DMV further explained : "" Volvo Car Finance should be able to provide documentation of when they took over the lien or when they merged with the old lienholder or bought the company. If they ca n't provide that documentation, have them provide you a signed and dated letter on company letterhead stating that they are unable to provide the documentation of when or how the lien was acquired ''. My problem is that Volvo refuses to explain this. I can call them and give them the VIN number, my name & address and without so much as batting an eye, they will give me a release letter. How can they do that without knowing if they have a vested interest in the boat? But to get them to write how they acquired the loan, etc, they will not do. I have faxed to XXXX my supporting letter, my trailer registration, and a copy of the monthly bill from XX/XX/XXXX. That last occurred on XX/XX/XXXX to the fax number XXXX.

CEOs of the American Express card company refused to close all accounts that links to my name and Social Security Numbers since year XXXX. I can prove it, please see attached. For the last 8-9 years, my sibblings and their friends ILLEGALLY use my Social Security numbers to commit Credit Card Frauds especially American Express cards and Mail Thefts. They refused to pay the bills and insisted on saying the Credit Cards are not under their name. I found out from the court house that American Express card company did tried to sue me however I did NOT receive any subpoenas because my sibblings and their friends committed Mail Thefts and Mail Frauds. I do NOT know who impostered me that day in court. But the case was Dismissed without prejudice. And from what I heard from my sibblings, an ILLEGAL deal was made to put me in debts that don't belong to me and to put my Elderly parents in debts as well. CEOs of the American Express card company "" created, printed out and ILLEGALLY distribute physical American Express Credit Cards in suspicious NUMEROUS AMOUNTS for 2 specific companies to pay for their daily breakfast, dinners in XXXX XXXX, CA etc. These people SCHEMED to expect me to be responsible for their bills especially when they FALSIFIED me to be a "" Philanthropist '' and even continues when they put me XXXX in year XXXX. I have lived in several XXXX XXXX  using their assigned IDs and experienced ALOT. I am NOT XXXX nor live in XXXX anymore. But that does NOT give any CEOs nor anyone especially my sibblings, their friends and specific companies to use me nor put me in debts out of SCHEMING, BELITTLEMENTS and BULLYINGS. My parents and I do NOT qualify to have any American Express card applications to be approved for the last 5 years. CEOs of American Express Card company and all these people took advantage of me and my parents for so many years. I have attached proofs that my application was declined. My Elderly XXXX XXXX XXXX father who has XXXX XXXX and urinates in XXXX XXXX XXXX and already moved from a 2 bedroom apartment to a single room with his wife has Identity Theft problems for 22-23 years without knowing and did NOT know his credit score do NOT qualify to have any Credit Cards especially American Express card application to be approved. Personally these CEOs needs to be investigated for such BULLYING and BELITTLEMENTS for the last 8 years. They ruined our lives!!!!! I need American Express card company to CLOSE all accounts that link to the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS of my parents and I PERMANENTLY and FLAG our names, POSSIBLE ALIAS NAMES these people have been using and information from being used by American Express card company PERMANENTLY. I am a VERY HEALTHY person since the beginning and I did NOT give anyone permission to use me NOR my parents for so many years!!!!! WE ARE NOT PHILANTHROPISTS AT ALL. Because of years of Bullying and BELITTLEMENTS and allowing all these people to Bully and to Belittle my parents and I by putting us in OBSCENE DEBTS, I need the CEOs and the American Express card company to send me all the statements in details of the last 8 years or so that link to my Social Security Numbers and my parents ' SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WITHOUT the CEOs of the American Express card company acting SLICK and SHADY by giving what I requested to my sister nor to her XXXX XXXX who falsified on ILLEGAL contracts nor to this XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX nor to XXXX XXXX who both imposter me for years who FALSIFIED permission. And I want all the American Express card company debts that linked to my ELDERLY parents ' and my SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS to show up in our CREDIT REPORTS in details for the last 8 years or more even if the debts got balanced transferred or closed as DOCUMENTATIONS. I need to know "" where and who '' the debts got transfer to so I can CONFRONT them in courts Individually. I know I did NOT meet any American Express card CEOs in my entire life NOR did I ever anger them. This BULLYING, BELITTLEMENTS and SCHEMING needs to end PERMANENTLY with financial compensations DIRECTLY to my parents and I. I would hope XXXX will punish all BULLIES",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,CA,,,Consent provided,Web,12-06-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3273215

This fall, in XXXX, the company changed the way they notify customers of payments due. In the past, they sent emails containing the amount due on the card, which I would then pay using secure bill payment with my XXXX app. Please see screenshots of emails below. I included one from before the change and two from after the change, which offered no reason for me to think I had a past due payment. I missed a payment due to this change, which I was never notified about. I paid the principle as soon as I realized it was due, but did not realize I had an outstanding late fee, which continued to accrue fees over the next two months. When I received a letter from XXXX in the mail asking for payment, I was shocked and made the payment as soon as I could. However, this 90-day-late payment has now caused my credit score to go down 90 points, and will not leave my credit report for 7 years. As a medical student in my mid-twenties, this is a major problem. I need to have a good credit score in order to qualify for loans. I have taken this matter up with XXXX, and while they were able to reduce my late fee, they refused to do anything to help me get this delinquent payment off my credit report, which is the far more critical and pressing issue.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,IL,,,Consent provided,Web,06-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3171698

I was trying to retrieve funds the week after when I noticed that the account was blocked. I immediately called said banking institution, CAPITAL ONE 360, concerned asking for details on my blocked account. Several questions were asked to confirm my identity. Everything was confirmed, then they explained the matter. I wasnt aware of what was going on, or what was done. They then flipped the script and tried to blame me for the security risk. They victimized me and played the blame game. I then asked for my banking relationship to be terminated, which they happily agreed to. I asked to have all incoming deposits made to the account blocked off while they still investigate, which they agreed to since I get my direct deposit to this account. CAPITAL ONE 360 is still allowing my funds to go into the hacked account. My employer cant stop any deposits into the account until they can confirm with the bank. CAPITAL ONE 360 is now refusing to give me access to the account, withdraw my funds and wont allow me to transfer my money out of the account.

19-02-2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card,"This is the timeline of the events : 1. XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX., charge of {$86.00} with my XXXX XXXX at a Restaurant XXXX XXXX XXXX, Washington D.C. 

2. My cycle ends day 4 of every month. Upon receiving my monthly statement in XXXX, I noticed that this charge changed to exactly twice the amount : {$170.00}. I disputed the amount online. 

3. On XX/XX/XXXX I was given a PERMANENT credit for {$86.00}. Citi case # XXXX. 

3. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received in the regular mail a letter from Citi, Dispute Department, signed by XXXX XXXX, Service Specialist, Phone XXXX, email : XXXX asking for supporting information of my dispute, and saying : "" ... if we don't hear from you by XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 days upon receiving this letter ), we'll investigate with the information we have available, and the conditional credit may be reversed ''. 

4. Same date ( this was in the evening after I got home from my office ) I called customer services, explained the situation and expressed surprise for the letter and time frame given to answer the letter and provide supporting documents, considering that I already received an email confirming the permanent resolution of the dispute, and the information online, in the dispute center, indicated that the dispute has been permanently resolved. The customer service person agrees with me, that he was also looking at the same information on his screen. Nevertheless, he transferred my call to the dispute center. 

5. XXXX XXXX was not available, but the person who answered the phone said that it was strange that I got an email, that they ONLY inform about dispute resolution by regular mail. She dismissed my observation about the two days given in the letter to provide information, and said that I could scan my receipt and sent it to the email above, as well as a scanned copy of the form. I play along, and I did so, sending an email the same night at XXXX XXXX 

6. The following day, I called the restaurant, explain the situation, and they apologizes for the mistake. They offered to give me the credit on the spot, but I explained that I had already a conditional credit from citi, and to avoid confusions, it would be better to follow their process. They agree and stated that as soon as they receive the phone call from citi, they would confirm that there was an error. 

7. On XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX, I receive an email from Citi ( reminder, the dispute center said they do not communicate by email the resolution of a dispute ( sic ) ), indicating that my dispute has been resolved. Happily, I signed on my account online ( as I did when in XX/XX/XXXX they already told me that the dispute was permanently resolved in my favor ), and to my surprise, I found an electronic letter saying that : "" after reviewing the dispute and the information you provided, we're unable to resolve the dispute in you favor ... ''. I was really surprised, considering that I send them a copy of my receipt that I signed in the restaurant, and the fact that the restaurant already agrees on the mistake ( you can not refute a hard copy proof ). 

8. I immediately called customer services and explained the situation, and asked for the right instance to file a formal complaint and a resolution of the problem. The person on the phone was also surprised. He gave me a PO Box for the "" Office of the President '', for XXXX in South Dakota. He also offered me a {$100.00} credit for being a "" loyal customer '' ( I have a Citi AA Visa card since XXXX, which was arbitrary changed to a MC in XXXX ). I told him that I was grateful for that, but this was an issue of principles. There is a mistake and citi has to fixed and acknowledge it in writing. 

9. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I called the restaurant again. They were surprised by the action taken by Citi, they said that Citi NEVER called them. XXXX, in charge of accounting, gave me on the spot a credit for the amount. She entered the transaction manually in the system, and she was kind enough to send me a scanned copy of the receipts. That transaction was recognized in the system only on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

10. I have copy of all documents, receipts, emails, etc., described above. After doing some research in the internet, I realized that there are many similar complaints, handled by the "" Office oft the President '',  without much success. But at the same time, I "" discover '' the existence of your office, and I decided to send my complaint to you instead. It is very difficult for Citi to be a fair judge of what has happened, and a third neutral party is better suited to clarify this issue, and avoid future occurrences to other consumers, by "" encouraging '' Citi to improve their internal coordination, particularly in such a critical unit as the Dispute Center. 

I believe, because of negligence and wrong doing from Citi despite the evidence provided as requested, some action is needed. In the best case scenario, this is not a systemic behavior, but a problem with the staff managing disputes, which is also bad, and should be of public interest to avoid repetition of this behavior with other customers. Thanks for you kind attention to this complaint and please, let me know if I can be of any help.

07-02-2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"I called Bank of America as I noticed I was being charged a $ XXXX   monthly maintenance fee on my personal checking account. The customer service rep advised that the fee was correct based on the type of account I had. He then retracted his statement to say that he provided the wrong information in error as they were using a new tool called XXXX XXXX. He then stated that based on the product I have theres certain criteria and thresholds to help avoid fees. One of the criteria was to maintain at least a {$2000.00} average daily balance in my savings account. There was several months of which I met this criteria, however Ive continued to be accessed with this {$14.00} fee for several years. The customer service rep proceeded to advise me that since I was just notifying them of the error that there was nothing I could do to be refunded for the bank error. I asked to speak with a supervisor and the representative advised that the only option was to request a callback. After insisting that a callback was not acceptable, the customer service rep returned to the call and stated I had the option to wait on a supervisor but the industry has moved away from that option asa whole. I then spoke with a supervisor after being on the phone for approximately 1 hour. My conversation with XXXX XXXX ( supervisor )  lasted for another hour. She assured me that the bank doesnt make errors and that I had not met the criteria. I requested that she pull my monthly statements as I was currently looking at them on the BOA app and it showed I had met the criteria for multiple months. She then downloaded the statements to see that I was correct. She placed me on hold and returned to agree to waive 6 months worth of fees as I had met the criteria however she advised it was still my error as my accounts werent linked based on a solutions based option that would have been offered to me years ago. I asked when was this offered and she stated the bank doesnt keep any documentation beyond 7 years. She then proceeded to say that I must dispute any fee errors within 60 fats of the errror and that they would only go back 1 year. I asked since I have fees in error dating back for more than 1 year, what could I do for a solution? She advised they dont go over internal bank policy with the customer so there was nothing she could do further.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",VA,238XX,,Consent provided,Web,07-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3146018

18-02-2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I have a Fidelity credit card. On the card was mostly a charge for my son 's college bill of approximately {$9500.00}. The entire credit card bill was {$9800.00}. I had money in my son 's educational account to pay most of the bill and was assisted by someone at Fidelity to transfer this money over to the credit card account. A small amount of additional money was needed from his account for which I sold a bond. This was not going to be credited until XX/XX/XXXX. I had other means to pay the bill but wanted to pay directly from my son 's account for tax reasons. The Fidelity representative told me not to be concerned because the credit card withdrawals were never made on the due date. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I kept an eye on the account and called Fidelity to check on whether or not the credit card withdrawal was being made ; there was no alert from the credit card department, which is a separate company, about an upcoming payment. The Fidelity representative told me that if there was to be a transfer it would have shown up. By the last time I checked at XXXX XXXX  there was still no alert so I assumed everything was all set. Several weeks later i got a notice that none of the bill was paid. I called them and was told that the payment hit in the middle of the night despite there being no notification during the business day. Instead of taking what was available, they took nothing and charged me a large fee for nonpayment. Even though all the money was in the account for the payment by XX/XX/XXXX the money was left untouched and no one notified me of the problem. Is there a law that was violated requiring the credit card company and/or the bank to give a heads up by the end of the business day that money would be pulled from my account that night? The payment went through so everything looked right with the account but it was rejected on XX/XX/XXXX. I feel taken advantage of ; there was no way to get this straightened out despite all my efforts. 

In summary, the credit card company should have provided a heads up the day that the money was to be withdrawn so I would have known and paid a different way. There must be a law about this because I have always received such alerts in transactions of this type. Given the lack of notification, the credit card company should have withdrawn the funds on the XXXX. By then the money would have been in the account. Plus they had my phone number ; obviously I was trying to pay the bill since most of the money was available for the payment. They should have at least applied that money. In fact some of the money was cashed in rewards from the credit card itself. Not even that was applied.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,MA,,,Consent provided,Web,18-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3155378

When I called back the person who immediately answered the phone did not state their name or the name of the company, she immediately said, thank you for holding. This was a cause for concern for me as usually when a call is answered at a business, the person answering the phone states the name of the business and their name, not thank you for holding especially when you were never on hold and had just dialed straight through. I asked the person who answered the call who they were and what was the nature of the call, she immediately asked me if the last 4 of my social was XXXX and if my date of birth was XXXX. I asked again who she was and the nature of the call and she refused to tell me who they were or the purpose of the call because I would not verify the last 4 of my social and date of birth. I explained to the person that I was not doing any of that and again asked who exactly this company was and what exactly the purpose of the call was regarding. Again the person stated that she was not able to do so unless I verified my personal information. I explained to the person that as far as I was concerned this could be a scam due to her lack of providing me the nature of the call, and more information regarding the company especially when this company was calling me at my place of employment with vague responses. The person yet again told me that she was not able to provide me any additional information without me first verifying my social security number and date of birth. My last statement to this person was that if in fact this was a personal business matter involving myself, that they needed to contact me on my personal cell number and not at my work number. The person asked me to verify my cell number to which my response was that if this was in fact anything dealing with me personally, and with them already utilizing my work number that they should obviously have my personal cell number. The person then stated that she would have my work number removed from their system. I've also attempted to visit the website that the robo call provided, however when utilizing the "" account number '' provided by the robo call, the system is still asking that my information be verified without any indication what this is in regards to. For this reason I believe that this company is acting under false pretenses and could possibly be a scam to gain information from consumers. I have XXXX  both telephone numbers, neither of which show to belong to a company called Direct Recovery Services LLC.

Ive been making my payment ON time since I have had the car. But received nothing but poor customer service and attitude. I was recently hurt on the job XX/XX/XXXX and was out of work for 4 months. Still making every payment on time all to find out that XX/XX/XXXX was the LAST time they reported my payments to the Credit bureau Transunion. My payment is due twice a month with the amount of XXXX. $ bi weekly. I noticed my credit score didnt really go up and I also have 2 credit cards that I pay on time every month. So this last time I made my payment last Wednesday I asked the agent who took the payment how come my credit score hasnt went up from making my payments on time she then expressed to me that their system has been down since XX/XX/XXXX. I was disappointed because Ive been working so hard to build my credit all for them to not be reporting and didnt even reach out to customers to let them know whats going on. They was trying to be sneaky and got very hostile when I told her I would have to report this to the credit company and another 3rd party to get this resolved. The agent couldnt tell me an exact date on when their System would be back running. Once I contacted Transunion they expressed to me that no credit report was given to them since XXXX of XXXX this is very unacceptable and I would like to take further action. This finance company doesnt even allow you to make late payments or your car wont start and they will repo it. So for their policy to be so Strick they should be on top of things and follow the rules and regulations as well! I will never recommend anybody to finance with this company XXXX XXXX they are a rip off and have high interest fees and very very unprofessional and on top of that they dont even offer gap insurance which is a very significant perk to purchasing a car.

We wrote a detailed letter to the Caliber Escrow Dept. seeking elimination of PMI ( complying with their required BPO house value estimate, at a {$100.00} cost to us ) and also requesting elimination of our escrow ( we had done this with our previous house with XXXX XXXX because of similar problems ). We never received direct answers to these inquiries in our letter. We have repeatedly been given the run around, or canned answers that don't answer our questions. We are current on the loan and have never been even a single day late with our payment. 

Tired of the escrow abuse. This happened with our last house ( XXXX XXXX ) and is happening again with Caliber Home Loans. Currently, they are in receipt of {$2000.00} they initially paid to XXXX for home insurance ( they paid them but XXXX returned it because we paid it along with our auto insurance ). We believed we would be able to eliminate the escrow and pay taxes and insurance ourself. Also the PMI should be eliminated based on our paying {$100.00} for a BPO estimate. This of course ties into the escrow. If we pay insurance -- and we didn't even request reimbursement from the escrow for the {$450.00} flood insurance after Harvey we already paid for -- then without PMI too, the escrow amount should be around {$700.00} per month not close to {$1000.00} as it is now ( taxes of about {$8300.00} ). What is Caliber doing? Pooling everyone 's escrow to their benefit. There is no reason the {$11000.00} should sit in an escrow account without earning interest, especially when their calculation of the escrow is wrong.

Caliber from day one has gotten their end of the bargain -- timely mortgage payments of principal, interest and escrow. Also after Harvey we have maintained both homeowner 's and flood insurance. Now, we simply want the escrow to reflect accurately the account or, preferably, be eliminated as we are able to easily pay the year end taxes.",,"Caliber Home Loans, Inc.",TX,774XX,,Consent provided,Web,19-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3156656

I returned his call last night(XX/XX/18), and again left a voicemail message, in which I invited him to send me something in writing for my review, if his calls pertained to a legitimate business matter. I asked him to stop calling me. 

I have received voicemail messages from him again today(XX/XX/18), in which he refused to send me anything in writing, threatened to send me a court summons via process server, and was generally demeaning and belligerent. Mr. ""XXXX"" suggested I may need an interpreter, as I was not understanding plain English, and must speak a different language. He also suggested I did not take legal matters seriously, and was trying to ""blow him off"". 

This company has violated several items within the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I would like Karl Frankovitch and his employees to cease and desist, I would like them to be penalized for the FDCPA violations, and I would like compensation from them. 

Some of the violations include:
§ 806.  Harassment or abuse 
A debt collector may not engage in any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:
 (5) Causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number.

§ 807.  False or misleading representations
A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:
 (2) The false representation of --
(A) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt; or
 (4) The representation or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of any person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment, or sale of any property or wages of any person unless such action is lawful and the debt collector or creditor intends to take such action.
(5) The threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.
 (7) The false representation or implication that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct in order to disgrace the consumer.
(10) The use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.

§ 809.  Validation of debts
(a) Notice of debt; contents
Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing --
(1) the amount of the debt;
(2) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;
(3) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector;
(4) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector; and
(5) a statement that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.
(b) Disputed debts
If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection (a) of this section that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. Collection activities and communications that do not otherwise violate this subchapter may continue during the 30-day period referred to in subsection (a) unless the consumer has notified the debt collector in writing that the debt, or any portion of the debt, is disputed or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor. Any collection activities and communication during the 30-day period may not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumer’s right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor.
(c) Admission of liability
The failure of a consumer to dispute the validity of a debt under this section may not be construed by any court as an admission of liability by the consumer.
(d) Legal pleadings
A communication in the form of a formal pleading in a civil action shall not be treated as an initial communication for purposes of subsection (a).

AND...
§ 813.  Civil liability 
(a) Amount of damages
Except as otherwise provided by this section, any debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter with respect to any person is liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of --
(1) any actual damage sustained by such person as a result of such failure;
(2) (A) in the case of any action by an individual, such additional damages as the court may allow, but not exceeding $1,000;",,Law Firm of Karl Frankovitch,OR,972XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,04-01-2019,Untimely response,No,N/A,3097118

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter. 

Approximately XX/XX/2019, I noticed ten inquiries on my file that I did not authorize. I called Transunion immediately to inform them of the fraudulent inquiries. These items were included in an identity theft report ( police report provided as well ). Today, XX/XX/2019, I called to check status of my report. The agent refused to acknowledge the FCRA law in 605b pertaining to the removal and blocking these inquiries WITHIN 4 BUSINESS DAYS. I read the law to him word for word from the FCRA, yet he still refused to honor my request. My rights have been violated and something needs to be done! 

The inquiries are as follows : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2019 )XXXX XXXX  ( XX/XX/2019 ), XXXX ( XX/XX/2019 ), XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/2019 ), XXXX  ( XX/XX/2019 ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2019 ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2019 ), XXXX  ( XX/XX/2019 ), XXXX ( XX/XX/2019 ), and XXXX ( XX/XX/2019 )!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NV,895XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,16-04-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3213906

On XX/XX/2018 I went to to XXXX XXXX practice for a XXXX  and XXXX covered by my insurance. While in her XXXX  chair she solicited me and convinced me to replace my XXXX with a XXXX  by offering me financing at 0 % for 5 years. She told me I was approved and immediately continue to work in my XXXX. During the middle of the procedure while XXXX XXXX  She came back with papers for me to sign. She never told me it was a credit card and never gave me any document with the terms and conditions. 
3 weeks later I received a credit card for {$7000.00} from Synchrony Bank/Carecredit for 26.99 % ( which she already depleted within minutes of being in the XXXX  chair. ) .Surprised at getting a credit card in the mail, I immediately contacted Synchrony bank to dispute the charge interest rate. Synchrony Bank/carecredit advised me to contact the vendor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  which I did. After several calls to her office, her customer representative told me that they have contacted Synchrony Bank/carecredit to make the adjustment to reflect 0 % for 5 years. Several calls to Synchrony revealed that to date XXXX XXXX had not called Synchrony to have this information regarding the interest rate adjustment or corrected, Which lead me to believe that XXXX XXXX had been engage in bait and switch to receive and use the funds to her advantage causing me financial, physical, emotional, mental stress and anxiety. Its been over 5 months of pain and suffering because of the poor job she did on my XXXX  causing me to go to Urgent care twice as a result of her damage. I have been unable to sleep at night because of the anxiety and stress associated with the interest rate of this card and fear of seeing another XXXX  and possibility of filing bankruptcy. As a widow, I never would accept or even apply for a card that is 26.99 %. This XXXX was unnecessary because my XXXX  was ok. The only reason I accepted her offer was because she told me her financing is at 0 % for 5 years. 
I am disappointed that Synchrony bank would take side with the crocked XXXX who will eventually force me to file bankruptcy because of XXXX XXXX unethical and fraudulent behavior. I still can not believe that within minutes XXXX XXXX duped me out of a total {$15000.00} that included what my insurance covered and {$7000.00} from Synchrony bank. Despite the several calls to synchrony bank and to XXXX XXXX office to get this matter resolved I am yet to get justice. On XX/XX/2018 XXXX, a manager ay Synchrony bank told me he would reverse the interest rate to 0 % for 60 months. A month later i got a letter from Synchrony bank reversing that decison and was told that XXXX XXXX has to call in and make the changes. XXXX XXXX  representative from XXXX customer relations ( XXXX ) told me she called Synchrony bank to correct the problem. Synchrony Bank says they never receive a call from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX office.

I have made every payment until my payment due on XX/XX/XXXX until they provide me my tag, if they don't then the car will be going back to the dealer if I cant get it resolved here and subsequently removed from my credit and a refund of all payments made to the Auto Credit including taxes and tags will be returned even if I have to seek legal counsel assuming it cant be resolved here.
