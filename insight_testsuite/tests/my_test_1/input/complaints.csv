Now that my funds are to be released they are not giving me the correct status because they said I missed a payment. I was told multiple times that the only way to pay is through the agency servicing my loan i now found out I could've paid directly after I called. I plan to file suit against both parties for damages and pain and suffering as I have been taking these classes with NO indication that I wouldn't have funding and now the school fully expects me to pay for them. This is not fair and unjust. I have attached my letter showing that I am eligible for funding.

XX/XX/2019 I wake up at XXXX check my account and to my surprise I didnt see a deposit transaction, I thought that it maybe to early and took the representatives word I had spoken to the day before to heart and went about my business. 

At XXXX that same day I checked my account and still no payment, I called the number provided and spoke with a rep and I was told to wait three days before calling back in because in order for the funds to bounce back ( from wherever they were since payment wasnt recieved by me ) and then I could request the payment again. 

In all I have been going back and fourth with this company providing any proof I can to verify I didnt receive payment for a loan I am to this day being held accountable for. 

I have e-mails on my end making numerous attempts to verify any information and at the end of the day for the company to tell me Im responsible for the loan ( even though I didnt receive payment ) because they cant trace where the payment went so their acting as if I did receive funds. 

To me, its absurd that this company is perfectly fine with putting someone in a further financial strain and to be okay with {$680.00} dollars just disappearing ... Nobody knows where it went but I have to pay for it.. 




On the banking end, I online bank with XXXX. Ive also contacted this company in order to figure out where the funds went because when a ACH is initiated the my name and social security number is encrypted in order to verify the correct personal has received payment.

16-01-2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from chase stating that they are reporting my Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) as charged off on XX/XX/XXXX with unpaid balance of {$24000.00}.

They stated they canceled the balance owed on XX/XX/XXXX and issued a XXXX. and as a result updated charge off balance to {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and reported to credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX.

Further they state they carefully reviewed the account and did not find any misrepresentations, unfair tactics or tried to be deceiving.

And that they are required to report accurately.

The problem with these statements are my credit report shows a charge off in the payment history on XX/XX/XXXX. Then the next data entry shows a charge off on XX/XX/XXXX.

The status shows a balance update and status of charge off update to be XX/XX/XXXX when they clearly said in the letter the balance was canceled on XX/XX/XXXX. If the balance is {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX it should state XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX.

The next problem is the XXXX they furnished in the letter and sent to the irs shows an identifiable event code of ( F ) By Agreement. This would have to mean that I made an agreement with them to cancel the debt owed for less than the full balance. This would be false.

The date of the Identifiable event is XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the Irs regulations prior to XX/XX/XXXX. If a debt has not been paid for 36 months and active collection is not pursued then a XXXX is to be issued even if the debt is not discharged. The account was delinquent prior to XX/XX/XXXX and closed and charged off XX/XX/XXXX. A XXXX should have been issued prior to XX/XX/XXXX. So in this case the XXXX was issued in the wrong year with incorrect event coding Finally according to XXXX  county land records there was a mortgage assignment filed for this account. The Assignment of mortgage was not to Chase Home Finance nor Chase Home Lending. Which gives reason to believe the incorrect creditor is reporting the debt and that they do not have a valid claim. Whether the Assignment of mortgage is valid is speculative considering the notary had been suspended and the agent on behalf of Chase may or may not have worked for Chase.

My actions have been contacting Chase about the misrepresentations and they have stated the account has been charged off since XX/XX/XXXXbut it is still open and they are reporting correctly.

I disputed with Credit Reporting Agencies to validate the information which is clearly incorrect. The came back that they only report what they are told to and that it was validated.

I have submitted a prior complaint to CFPB which contacted Chase which responded with the letter that I have explained.

I have continually ran into problems getting credit due to this account reporting the charge off as XX/XX/XXXX since Derogatory Credit waiting periods require 4 years though the Charge Off had occurred XX/XX/XXXX. The cancellation of debt was XX/XX/XXXX which is not a charge off especially if the account was already charged off.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,IL,601XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,16-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3126827

07-01-2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"During several dates, I have sent certified mail to the credit bureaus asking them to verify the inaccuracies of the information on the bankruptcy they are reporting. On my report, it lists the liabilities and assets being {$0.00}. This is not accurate and you can see this highlighted on the report attached. On several dates, I received the response from the bureau stating they verified the information. I then sent a letter to the XXXX County Court Clerk 's office asking if they verified the information to the bureaus. They sent me a letter stating that they do not provide information to the bureaus. The XXXX creditor was sent a letter for verification and validation and they have not responded to my request and have exceeded the mandatory 30 day time limit. XXXX XXXX was also contacted and has not sent verification.

My complaint is this, I challenged the Items based upon the inaccurate reporting of the {$0.00} assets and {$0.00} Liabilities on my report for the BK. Pertaining to the XXXX account, they have not responded to certified mail and confirmed verification and validation of their inaccurate reporting. The XXXX XXXX account jumps instantly into 60 day late reporting mark but does not say a 30 day period was breached. I have also added proof that these bureaus are not doing a true verification and supplying relevant proof while not flippantly dismissing the FCRA mandated rules. The bureaus also refuse to provide and form of evidence there for proving their verification. The Bureaus claimed that they had verified the information, when clearly they could not have for two reasons for the BK, 1 ) it is impossible to have a bankruptcy and have {$0.00} liabilities and {$0.00} assets reported 2 ) the bureaus claimed they verified the information, yet the source of the information sent me a letter that they do not verify information with the courts. Also, I put a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX report yet they used that agency ( NO third party can verify per FCRA ) as a third party.

This leads me to conclude that the credit bureaus never conducted a reasonable investigation on this inaccurate information for the BK. For the XXXX account they have not responded to my request for validation and verification and time has lapsed past 30 days.

In my certified mail I also requested they remove any inquiries that are not currently associated to any account. The credit bureaus also said they verified the information but can't provide any proof. If they do have proof they have not provided that to me after many requests.

I would like to have this inaccurate records removed from my credit report as it is reporting inaccurately and incomplete on my report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,761XX,,Consent provided,Web,07-01-2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3118512

Unbeknownst to me, the representative I had spoken to reversed my entire XXXX mortgage payment instead of just crediting me the {$7.00} that was erroneously taken out of my checking account. Upon attending our closing, and our title closer speaking with the representative from XXXX XXXX and receiving the closing figures, we successfully concluded our closing thinking everything was fine. A month later I received a notice from XXXX XXXX advising we were in arrears in our mortgage payment. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX explaining that we had closed that account on XX/XX/18. They advised that they indeed saw the money for the pay-off of the mortgage however it was being held in a suspense account pending further investigation. I told them to expeditiously examine the issue and get back to me asap. After not hearing from them for over a week, I called the servicing center and spoke to an agent that informed me I owed them {$2000.00} for XXXX mortgage payment. I said that was incorrect as I was enrolled in EFT which automatically pays my mortgage. I was then apprised with the fact that XXXX XXXX had reversed the entire mortgage payment for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX instead of crediting me the {$7.00} I had requested. I told them at no time was I EVER made aware that the entire XXXX payment was being reversed as I would not have allowed that to happen. They told me they would "" look into this ''. I also advised them that THEIR AGENT gave the figures at the closing on XX/XX/XXXX which indicated that XXXX XXXX knew the payment was reversed and should have included that in the closing numbers. I then went back and forth with XXXX XXXX for several weeks regarding this disaster speaking with agent after agent and vehemently demanded that no action be taken with any credit agency until AFTER a full investigation of the issue was resolved as this was surely the fault of XXXX XXXX. I was assured by a supervisor at XXXX XXXX that indeed no action would be taken. In XXXX, I was notified by the credit agencies that our credit score had dropped over 200 points due to late payments on our mortgage! I again contacted XXXX XXXX demanding they reverse this negative report only to be told they can not. I am sure you know that a negative report against a mortgage is a killer to your credit.

I made constant and repeatedly frustrating attempts to speak to their customer service department and resolve the issues and pay my bill, all without success. 
It wasn't until a customer services rep called me to ask about payment that I was able to get the situation resolved, at this point the bill was 60 days late. 

The bill was immediately paid, I was driving at the time and pulled of the highway to deal with the call, the rep got my web account fixed AND we set up an automatic reoccurring minimum payment to prevent any future late payments. 

Unfortunately, the automatic reoccurring minimum payment only worked for 2 months and then failed. I received another call from a customer service rep after the XX/XX/2015 payment went late, which I was unaware of, after all it had worked for the previous 2 months. 

I immediately paid the outstanding bill, and the Customer service rep found the account notes and fixed automatic reoccurring minimum payment issue.

I applied with the latter agency in XX/XX/XXXX. I sent a letter along with a paycheck stub showing my base monthly pay and requested that they calculate my monthly payment on this amount instead of my XXXX tax returns because I was able to acquire extra work throughout that year. However, it's not guaranteed income, and indeed, I've not been able to secure the same amount of extra work in XXXX, and will be making a lot less. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX sent information about my monthly payments ( in the amount of {$180.00} per month ), which were scheduled to began in XX/XX/XXXX. A week ( no more than 2 weeks ) before this first payment was due, XXXX sent a letter saying that my monthly payment had increased to {$240.00}. There was no real explanation. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX, and a customer service rep said that I didn't fill out the application correctly, so they based the payments on my XXXX tax return. 
I was advised to reapply. I have. However, I've been pushed back into forbearance. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to make sure that I had indeed been put into forbearance ( and that they wouldn't report me for not making the XXXX payment ). The customer service representative who checked my account said that my monthly payment ( that had been scheduled for XXXX ) should be {$180.00}. 
I've since processed the reapplication, per the advisement from the XX/XX/XXXX call. It is accompanied by a letter from my employer that declares my base annual salary. 
Something very fishy is going on at XXXX, and given the unexplained, shifting of monthly payment amounts that come up every time I communicate with them, I believe that this complain is warranted. Please contact XXXX and ask them to send me information on how they have calculated the following monthly payments : {$180.00}, {$180.00}, and {$240.00}. 
Again, I've reapplied to have them calculate my monthly payments, but I'm doing so at a heavy cost, and it's not right.",,AES/PHEAA,NC,,,Consent provided,Web,04-12-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3076244

After a number of other mishaps during the pre-closing process, we were first told that XXXX finally submitted our application to the real lender this past Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). We were scheduled to close today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Despite assuring us on Friday that we were "" on track '' to close on time, XXXX and XXXX failed to disclose of mistakes delaying our close. They then failed to answer direct questions -- on Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday -- about when documents were sent so that we could evaluated whether closing needed to be moved and seek and extension from the sellers. Finally, at XXXX Wednesday XXXX -- hours before we were scheduled to close -- XXXX told me via a phone call that XXXX had mistakenly sent documentation to XXXX rather than the investor, XXXX XXXX, and that it lead to the delay. She then promised to provide me details in writing by the next morning so that I could assuage the sellers ' concerns and obtain an extension. 

On Thursday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a call from XXXX informing me that the information provided by XXXX -- which I had shared with the sellers as we tried to work towards delaying the closing at the last minute -- was incorrect. In fact, no information had been sent to XXXX. Rather, when the XXXX XXXX underwriter had returned the file to GR on XX/XX/XXXX, it had done so with a direction that the property appraisal be sent to collateral underwriting. GR ignored that direction until it finally sent the appraisal over to collateral review on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. This was not disclosed to us until my call with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 

On that same call, XXXX assured me that there would only be a 3-4 hour turnaround once approval from XXXX XXXX was received because our filed would be in "" rush '' protocol for GR. Coincidentally, XXXX XXXX sent over approval by collateral review just after our call, around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX left me a voicemail that afternoon indicating they had received approval and would "" work on a closing for tomorrow on a rush. '' Despite those promises, as of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX the file is still "" in line '' to be reviewed by underwriting. The sellers are now threatening not to extend the contract.

In XXXX of XXXX, I was notified by Experian that I was being given another free year of monitoring due to the breach but that I needed to renew through an online sign up. I signed up online and was required to provide credit card information to complete the registration.

19-05-2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"In addition to my TEACH Grants being wrongfully converted to loans in XXXX of XXXX, my loans have now been turned over to the US Department of Education for default. I am NOT in default. According to the most recent escalated rep that I spoke with on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were put in default on XX/XX/XXXX as a result of an error on their behalf. As XXXX, an escalated rep in the XXXX XXXX explained, the method by which they refunded money to me for payments made to grants, threw my loans into default. As she explained on XX/XX/XXXX, this is "" A big mess '', and it is by no fault of yours. '' I understand that the loans now must go to the "" XXXX XXXX '' and there is no timeline for the "" mess '' to be corrected. Meanwhile, my credit is trashed, and there is no estimated timeline that can be provided to me for the correction to occur. 
The numerous reps that I have spoken with since XXXX regarding my grants, Income-driven payment request, and public loan forgiveness program, have all given me contradictory information, and I have no faith in anyone I speak with there regarding my status on any of the above listed processes. For example, in XXXX, I had an escalated rep guide me through the Income-driven repayment application, wait on the phone until I completed the application, and uploaded to my online account. The next time I spoke with them regarding my expected refund for grant payments, I was told that the refund would not be issued, and that the payments would be credited to the overall loan amount. Yet, I was told in XXXX that I would be receiving a check by XX/XX/XXXX. During that same conversation, I took the opportunity to explain how I was exhausted from having to make numerous calls that usually exceeded 40 minutes, only to have to start over explaining the issues and repeating what I had been told on the previous conversation. Consistently, I was told that I was given incorrect information by previous rep. If it were not the truth, and if it did not cause stress, it would be comical - like a XXXX XXXX XXXX skit. Every rep provided different information regarding the same topic, even among escalated reps ( that I demanded to deal with every call since XXXX ). I complained about how it took 45 minutes and an escalated rep to teach me how to complete my IDR request so that I was not overcharged, and how upset I was that I had paid excessive payments for years because the application did not allow for me to correctly document my financial situation. In other words, I told the rep that the application "" baits '' you in to documenting income and spouse information that is not correct, but you are scared not to document it like that because of the liability you are subject to for filing false information. I told him how thankful I was that 5 years in to filing IDRs and making payments, someone was competent enough, and cared enough, to guide me through the application to get payment lowered where it should be. When I described that situation, the representative said that my IDR request provided "" false '' information, and that it could get me in trouble! I explained again that an escalated rep walked me through it, and waited on the phone for me to upload it and it be received. He said he can see where that happened, but unfortunately the rep gave me incorrect information. He said I could keep the payment where it is for now, but that I would have to file it differently if my husband and I file taxes jointly. 
There are many more occasions in which I have been provided false information and guidance, including information regarding the XXXX program. Obviously, Fed Loan Servicing reps have no accountability, and/or competence regarding protocols in any department. I have managed to get through, and have coped with the undue stress and excessive time and aggravation involved in managing my student loans, but default, I can not deal with! This is unbearable, and is negatively affecting my health. I am seeking legal advice. Thankfully, I have documented my calls since XXXX, with employee ID numbers. 
I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have worked at the same school, in the same position for 10 years. I pay my bills and am a law abiding citizen. Please advise.",,AES/PHEAA,AL,,,Consent provided,Web,19-05-2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3247132

I am sending this letter as of my final attempt to fairly allow you to do your job and kindly remove the errors that are reporting on my credit report. I've mentioned that i am a victim of identity theft. My information was also leaked in several breaches over the years but a recent one a few weeks in XXXX of 2019. Since it comes to my attention that you aren't responding maybe we should settle in court, which will work for me and i won't be wasting my time. I complied the evidence and paper work during the time when i sent in my letters and more. 

This letter is being sent to you in response to a computer generated, unsigned letter dated XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX ), letter received by Claimant from your offices. Be advised that your claim is disputed and validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt is requested in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692 and as amended by adding the following new Title 8 USC 802 et seq., and the Fair Credit Billing Act, 15 USC. 1666 et seq. All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq. It is not now, nor has it ever been, my intention to avoid paying any obligation that is lawfully owed by the Claimant. In order to make arrangements to pay an obligation which may be lawfully owed, please document and verify the debt by complying, in good faith, with this request for validation and return it to me, within thirty ( 30 ) days of receipt of this letter. 
This is NOT a request for verification or proof of Claimant mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION and PROOF OF CLAIM made pursuant to the above named Titles and Sections. I respectfully request that your offices provide Claimant with competent evidence as per the attached Declaration and Proof of Claim that I have any legal obligation to pay you the unsubstantiated alleged debt. Furthermore you shall cease all verbal communication. No phone calls to the Claimant. 
At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus, such as, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX prior to validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt, this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact ; if any negative mark is found on any of Claimant credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Violation of United States Code TITLE 18 PART 1 CHAPTER 63 1341 ( Mail Fraud ) This debt is considered to be invalid until I receive proper validation and your offices provide Claimant with proof of claim of the disputed debt. Your offices have 30 days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant credit reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. 
If your offices fail to respond to this validation and proof of claim request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from Claimant credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to Claimant immediately.

This is against the law because it is the plaintiff 's burden to validate debt. The court is not enforcing this and they both have the upper hand because they know the law and I do not. It is my opinion that the court and the credit collector are using fear and intimidation tactics to unlawfully gain money knowing that I am a layman in matters of law.

21-12-2018,Vehicle loan or lease,Lease,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,GM Financial 's website for billing has been reporting incorrectly for the almost 3 years I have leased a car. It continually shows the wrong amount due and incorrect due dates. Example : Login to the webpage it shows amount due as {$310.00} then look at the electronic statement and it shows {$290.00}. Consumers would be unsure as to what amount is actually due. Now at the end of the lease it shows {$750.00} due and no statement for XX/XX/XXXX. I called and they said I only owe {$140.00} ( which I paid ). I do not trust this company at all and I'm sure there will be more charges even though they tell me this XXXX 's out my account. This is very confusing and I have been very diligent to pay attention to statement amounts instead of the website but I'm worried that others would incur late payments and other financial hardships based on misinformation. This is very bad business. When I asked about this several times the only answer I got was they are working on it or they don't know why it shows this. I have talked to other GM financial customers who have similar stories. This needs to be investigated for predatory lending practices. I work for a large financial institution and if we did business like this we would be in trouble.,,"General Motors Financial Company, Inc.",MO,,,Consent provided,Web,21-12-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3106991

I understand the requirements that this be reported to the consumer within 5 days but subparagraph ( A ) states if authorized but the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. 

This account was throughly investigate and proven to be opened via fraudulent activity and XXXX/XXXX  was given ample time to respond to the evidence submitted to them. 
Experian deleted this erroneous account - which was also reported previously to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
FDCPA section 807 ( 8 ) and FCRA section Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).  Makes clear that these agencies and debtor have 30 Days to respond to my dispute - not a year and 30 days, I disputed and had this account removed over a year ago after being proven inaccurate, unverifiable, not mine, and incomplete.

Initially I was unable to use my card for several months upon credit approval. Several attempts to contact hsbc and several hours of being put on hold and hung up on lead to my initial complaint.

Now, I have completed the online banking months ago as well to manage my account. HSBCs initial classificationof my account has caused me not to have the ability to log on, I have also stopped receiving paper letters in the mail showing me my statement. Since opening I have made one payment over the phone for the complete balance. However now I do not know the remaining payments or due dates which is preventing me to make my payment and ensure I have a XXXX  balance. 

I hurt my credit by opening this account with the intention of using rewards points, benefiting from the annual match of points, using my rewards points, and benefiting from the 0 % transfer. 

I was forced to open an additional card to perform the balance transfer, further harming my credit score. I am unable to use my rewards points because I can not log online. I have been prevented from using my card for several months limiting the benefit I would receive in rewards points and more importantly the annual match. I can not make a payment on this account due to unknown balances which I have never had a late payment and am afraid this may occur due to the mismanagement of opening this account. 

In addition to the hours spent already in the aforementioned complaint I spent additional hours trying to fix my online banking issues. I have attempted several days to contact customer service and resolve this issue. They continue to transfer me from to different departments until I drop from the conversation. Attached are additional documents of me attempting to open my online activity. 

In the aforementioned complaint HSBCs response rewarded me with {$100.00} in rewards points. This is an inadequate amount based on the harm this experience has caused to me credit score and the inability to use the benefits of the card which is why I opened it. Additionally, I can not use any of the rewards I was provided because I can not log on to my accounts although several customer service agents confirmed I opened my online accounts correctly.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,CO,806XX,,Consent provided,Web,21-12-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3106996

This is stunning, since XXXX  checked into my dispute regarding this account and removed it immediately. Both XXXX and Transunion, however, refused despite several phone calls and dispute filings. I do not owe that company any money. I have never missed a credit card or loan payment in my entire life, and these credit reporting companies have now reported an unpaid delinquent debt that cost me about 50 points on their credit report. I asked the credit reporting companies whether there is a judgment against me of any kind with respect to this debt. Neither XXXX  nor Transunion could find any such judgment. Nevertheless, they stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed I owed money, and that was the end of the inquiry. I asked why my statement that I did not owe any money would not be held in the same regard as that company 's statement. But these companies had no valid answer. 

Furthermore, Transunion continued to add a suffix to my name that does not exist over my objection. XXXX  did the same thing. I disputed this with them, but only Transunion fixed the error. XXXX  refused, demanding personal information, which I was unwilling to send them due to their record of records ' breach ( which impacted me ). They stated  one company ( out of 50 accounts ) reported my name as XXXX, and they would take that company 's word over mine and that of 49 companies.  This was stunning, and to this day, the company continues to hold me out as someone I am not. 

I hope you can fix this!

I filled out a web form requesting a rate for a conventional loan. A loan officer contacted me and I gave him my information for a conventional loan. Much of the conversation was about him trying to get me to apply for an fha. I stated numerous times that I was already approved for an fha mortgage and that I did not want to consider an fha application. 
The loan officer stated that it didn't matter and that he could check on a conventional. 
After pulling my credit report he said that he could not qualify me for an fha for the amount that I wanted and I should not trust the preapproval 's I have received from the other lenders. Regardless that the other lenders have approved me based on verification of my assets and income and have been approved by underwriting. I said I didn't want to apply for an fha and that I would not be moving forward with their company. I filed a dispute with credit dispute with credit plus for the credit inquiry. The credit inquiry did not harm my credit score but the fact that this company requested an inquiry for a loan product ( conventional ) that they were never had the intent to approve me for I requested that they remove the inquiry from my report. 
I received a letter from credit plus with a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX through Credit plus from XXXX XXXX. The letter states that I applied for a mortgage over the phone with XXXX XXXX and that I gave verbal authorization for the credit report authorization. He further states I withdrew the application as they were not able to approve me for the amount that I desired. The truth is that I was applying for a conventional loan but the XXXX mortgage forms that they sent to the response has FHA checked off. In the box for assets it shows how much I had for a down payment and closing which was much larger than what I had stated I would use for the loan early in the process. Reason I withdrew was because that they were not offering the product I had requested I did not want to pay the fees involved with an FHA I could have increased my down payment to meet a DTI requirement. The false information that was being relayed from XXXX XXXX ( bait and switch tactics ) and I could not trust him nor his company is the reason I withdrew my application.",,Credit Plus Inc,IL,601XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,22-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3130643

This is not an account opened by me. The company responded in XX/XX/2017, indicating that I have not provided them with the required documentation, which is FALSE. I have been in contact with your investigators and have submitted all the information above once again on XX/XX/2017. On XX/XX/2017, I was contacted via email by Mr. XXXX XXXX, who stated he had not received the requested affidavit, I reminded Mr. XXXX that the required documents were sent to his inbox ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/2017. Mr. XXXX responded and stated that he required an incident report be filed as well, I replied informing Mr. XXXX that an incident report was not something I could furnish as per my notarized agreement with the Individual responsible, ( which I provided to the Lending Club ), in exchange for her admittance, I would not file charges. I have not heard from Mr. XXXX, nor any representative from The Lending Club since. The Lending Club has a copy of the signed agreement and all documentation, so I am unsure why they are requesting me to violate a notorized statement. 

This situation has dragged on for many years, and I am desperate to put it behind me. I am willing to work with the company, as I've always been, to come up with an agreement to resolve this issue once and for all. The entire ordeal of having someone extremely close to me cause such chaos, and turmoil in my life financially, mentally, emotionally and professionally has been tough to move past, especially with the remnants of her actions lingering on my credit report, military, and XXXX XXXX record. I ask The Lending Club to work with me to come to an agreement that is both fair and satisfactory to both, the company and myself so this situation can be put to an end once and for all.

There is no one else I can speak with ; there is no email address that can be used to communicate and deliver documentation. Either fax or regular mail. No attempt on their part to track receipt of said money using the information provided. 
rec 'd another statement dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating owing {$0.00}. Again I called and resubmitted the information regarding payment information ; they replied they had no way to track it, as they never received. Another notification of now the delinquency of over 60 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX - another call to Rushmore asking for assistance of tracking my payment and resolving the credit reporting. Still no assistance in helping. Therefore, I went to my bank and REWIRED ANOTHER PAYMENT. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX CST resent ANOTHER wire transfer with an additional cost to me of {$25.00} -- Also, contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they have record from XXXX , Rushmore Loan Management Services received funds XX/XX/XXXX. Trace # is XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX - again called Rushmore to give them information that I just wired ANOTHER PAYMENT and was told to call back on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX to verify they received. 
XX/XX/XXXX - called and they verified payment received and closed account. I asked about next step in resolving credit reporting and also let them know they now have received TWO payments from me. Gave them additional information again for THEIR bank with a tracking # XXXX. Their records indicate a follow up is needed by me next Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

Asked them to report to credit agencies their reporting that the account was not delinquent which affected my CREDIT SCORE greatly. They indicated they would send to consumer affairs department for investigation however it is still under investigation. They offer no customer service to assist in rectifying the situation other than the customer doing all the calling ; following up. I was told to call XX/XX/XXXX, or I can mail/fax communication and wait again for reply. There is no other communication other than the one customer service line and you are unable to speak with anyone else ; no supervisor or anyone other than the rep on the phone. 

This loan was first taken from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and the account was turned over in XX/XX/XXXX to Rushmore Loan. In six years paying the mortgage for a payoff amount of {$0.00} this company has ruined my credit and is making no attempts to assist in correcting the problem. 

As of today XX/XX/XXXX, Rushmore has now an additional {$73.00} due to the double payment in which they can not tell me how or when the payment will be reissued back to me. Again, no one to speak with at all to assist in resolving issue. 

I have made every attempt possible to rectify the situation with no assistance whatsoever from Rushmore other than being treated like an individual who is trying NOT to pay a {$0.00} debt when I clearly paid a {$15000.00} debt I owed timely.

After each occurrence I contacted the company to resolve the issue. I was continually told they would fix the problem and make sure future payments were allocated correctly. Yet the very next monthly payment was misallocated. Due to these errors, my payoff amount was incorrect and I overpaid. Ditech said they would investigate the problem and if I was owed any money they would send it in 30 days. They made an error yet they hold my reimbursement money hostage. 

The misallocated funds occurred in XXXX of XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, and XXXX of XXXX. Regular payments were applied to additional principal and any extra principal payments were applied to regular monthly payments then I was charged late fees, interest, etc. because the full monthly payment was not paid. 

There were also months that I did not receive my monthly statements. I had to contact Ditech to get a statement in order to have a voucher to send with my payment. 

My escrow was calculated incorrectly and misapplied as well. Ditech said they could not send me a corrected escrow statement when I asked for it. I never received anything stating the error was corrected. 

When my monthly payments were applied to additional principal, I was told by Ditech, that I had made the payments 1-3 days before the payment was due so they applied it to principal since my account was current. However, in the past I had made payments every two to three weeks and there was never a problem. If their policy is to apply all payments to principal should they be paid 1-3 in advance of the actual due date, they should have informed me ( the consumer ) of this change in policy. However, they did not. They continued to misallocate the payments despite my numerous attempts to rectify the problem. I even spoke to supervisors and was told someone in a management position would contact me to discuss the issue. This never happened. No one ever contacted me. 

Ditech customer service is extremely poor and they are not interested in resolving problems.

To correct this problem I am attempting to refinance my mortgage since the six month waiting period mandated by FHA has expired. This refinance is time sensitive as it has to be complete before the lender pays the next property tax bill this month which puts the escrow account into a negative balance. 

To make this happen correctly, I contacted Plaza to get the automatic draft of the mortgage payment from my bank account stopped and the tax payment delayed. I was assured both verbally and in writing that both of those things had been done, yet Plaza still drafted the payment out of my bank account. This has put the brakes on my refinance as it has totally changed the payoff amounts and affected closing costs.

I have been in contact with Plaza several times over the last two days since they did this and am getting nothing but run around. They promise calls back that never come and can not provide any explanation at all as to why they can not just fix their mistake.

Still til this day of XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received one physical document in the mail from Santander about this account and my current mailing address is listed on the documents they submitted to the Better Business Bureau. This debt has caused me tremendous problems when it comes to obtaining credit elsewhere and also when looking for a home whether renting or qualifying for a mortgage, which have ended in denials.",,Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.,FL,338XX,,Consent provided,Web,06-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3165100

15-08-2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I responded to HSBC 's promotion and opened an HSBC Advance Checking account in XXXX of 2019. Received an email that they processed my opening deposit on XX/XX/19. The promo stated that I had to keep the funds in for 90 days. Then, HSBC would take "" up to an additional 8 weeks '' to deposit the {$350.00} bonus amount. So, the timeline would take us to end of XXXX 2019. I called and emailed in XXXX. Nothing happened. I called an additional 3 times and emailed in XXXX and XXXX. The bonus should've been deposited by XX/XX/19!! I spoke to several people including supervisors. The names are XXXX, XXXX ( supervisor ), XXXX ( supervisor ) and today on XX/XX/19 XXXX. All emails responses and all phone calls ( which lasted about 45 min. each ) rendered absolutely no resolution OR timing. In fact ( and these calls should all be recorded and verifiable ). I was told that the Marketing Dept. was responsible for the Bonus but they were not allowed to contact them nor was a customer. Here I sit as a very frustrated and psychologically abused customer with no idea when or if my funds will be available. It's been an additional 6 weeks on top of the 90 days + 8 weeks. Each of the email responses I received within my HSBC account website states that their "" Management Team '' is working on it and needs more time. MORE TIME? This is a simple digital and electronic transaction. What is their "" Management Team '' actually working on. Really! Were they "" all '' hit by a bus. This offer was completely misrepresented and fraudulent. They seem to keep the customer in a black hole while they maximize their float income and take advantage of their customer. Unable to contact anyone at the organization with any authority to resolve this AND THEY stated that there is no one else I can contact. It's now about 6+ months waiting while I earn about .01 % which I did not see in any fine print! Is this blatant manipulation of the customer so HSBC can squeeze every last penny by delaying any contractually required payment. Total misrepresentation and pathetic customer service which HSBC claims in World Class!  How do any of the regulators let them get away with any of this.

One account is not even mine, the other was paid off and closed years ago. I first disputed on-line with no success. They returned results that stated "" all information correct and verified with reporting company ''. I then did a little research on how to have errors removed from your credit report, as well as spoke to an attorney that advised me to send certified letters to both companies asking that the accounts be verified with proof of that verification. One company ( A collection Agency ) refused the letter, the other sent me a response that said they had verified the information with the credit bureaus and was not required to provide any proof to me other than they verified my identity on this credit card ON-LINE. So apparently crooks don't open accounts on-line???!!! 
So I filed WRITTEN disputes to all three Credit Bureaus, sent them all Certified Mail, and just received a response from XXXX stating once again regarding the same account - "" Information verified with reporting agency '' and nothing more. That's it??? Of course the reporting agency is going to "" confirm '' that their information is correct, but don't they need to provide some sort of PROOF other than their word?!!!!! What more can I do as a consumer to have this addressed/investigated properly??? 
The other account that I am disputing flat out refused to accept the letter that I sent them certified. Now what? I've filed written dispute as well on this response, but have not gotten a response yet from any of the Credit Bureaus. 
I need assistance immediately in addressing XXXX  and their investigation processes.
