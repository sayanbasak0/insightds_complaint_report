So I decided to get security cameras. I had a email from this company so I responded and spoke to a lady who quoted me a price of XXXX dollars for this system. It included so I thought the front and back door camera 's. After the installation they gave you 3 days to cancel, but there was no reason to cancel it was working well. Then I finally got the bill about 30 days later and it was for over 800.00. I was floored. When I called the company they told me that some one would get back to me, no one ever did. The finance company said they went on what XXXX told them and they submitted 800+. When I spoke to someone at XXXX he stated XXXX was for the kit which I thought I was getting, but that I had an extra camera added. The front door camera. I explained to the that this was not within my budget and no one every told be anything about an extra camera I had to pay for or I would have told them to forget it. He told me that I would have to speak to someone in management who would listen to the initial call to see what was said. No one ever contacted me back so I called again. This time I spoke to a very rude lady. I explained that at the time of the sale, I asked the sales person what was better about her company and why I should go with them instead of another company that didn't require any out of pocket for cameras or installation. She was just a very nice person who seemed to be very concerned about my safety, that's how they got me. She told me they had better cameras and she was very comforting. I thought she was trying to help me, I was so concerned about what was going on around my house, that was really all I could think of. The only money this lady spoke of was XXXX. She never told me anything about 800+ dollars, she did say I would get a free camera. I feel like I was baited and switched. When I called again they told me that someone would get back to me with the voice recording of the sales pitch, but no one ever has. They are billing me XXXX a month for this 800.00+ for this equipment. I called today to get the pay off balance and to see where to send the check and they told me there is no place to send the check you have to do it on line. That was it for me.

I began the purchase of my home in XX/XX/XXXX and made the first payment of {$170.00} in XXXX of the same year. Now, twenty years later, after having paid 237 of 240 payments, my loan is at maturation. One of those last three payments was deferred a few months ago. The other two, I have refused to pay, until I receive the fully itemized account of my payment history, including the amount of the loan ( {$17000.00} ), the fixed rate of interest of 9.5 % ( no idea as to how it has been compounded ) ) ; the amount that has been applied to the interest, and the amount that has been applied to the principal. I made three oral requests in XXXX, and then one by email ( sent XX/XX/XXXX ), as I was finally instructed. On that same day, I was sent a reply from Ditech that my request had been received, and a representative would be in contact with me. 

A representative did indeed call and simply started asking me questions for which the answers were in my written request. I told the representative that I wasn't answering any questions ; that everything was in the email. I then told the person to simply send me the information I had requested ; and then we would talk. This is XX/XX/XXXX, and I have yet to have that requested information sent to me. However, representatives from Ditech continue to call every day, sometimes twice a day. 

Since the date of my first payment, I have paid 237 payments at {$170.00} a payment, for a total of {$40000.00}. That is on a {$17000.00} loan. I would think that my debt would be satisfied ; but Ditech still has me owing {$3400.00}. ( Three home owner 's insurance premiums ( that's another story ) of {$84.00} each, are included in this amount. ) In conclusion, I am of the opinion that my debt has been more than satisfied.

I repeatedly and tenaciously attempted to do this both online and via telephone. The Experian website offered me a P.I.N. that I could give to my bank to temporarily unlock my credit report, but my bank told me that they could not use a P.I.N., and that I should call Experian for assistance. 

Contacting Experian has been time consuming, frustrating, miserable, fruitless and IMPOSSIBLE! Experian is wasting my time, depriving me of the credit that I deserve, and XXXX me off. The government ought to put Experian out of business tomorrow morning. 

First I had to go on a treasure hunt for a telephone number to contact Experian, because a telephone number is either very well hidden or else nonexistent on the Experian website. I used several telephone numbers that I found on the internet and called them to no avail. Each Experian number I called required me to wade through seemingly endless voice prompts, starting with "" For English, press 1 '' which is to accommodate, at my expense, mind you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

When I finally was finished growing older and older and older and older while wading through computerized voice prompts, the end result for each of the several telephone numbers that I called REPEATEDLY was a recorded message telling me that Experian could not assist me, or words to that effect, along with a monotone apology and a suggestion that I "" try again later '', followed by disconnection.

The vet said XXXX would be required and I did not have enough money in my savings so the vet assistants offered me care credit and gave me a pamphlet about it. The pamphlet stated that I would have 6 months interest free on purchases and afterwards a 26.99 apr rate. This wasnt too different from my other credit cards so I naively agreed to it before reading care credits reviews. I took the offer and put {$1000.00} on credit from the vet bill. I payed the minimum monthly payment the first 6 months and expected the monthly interest afterwards to be $ 20- {$30.00}. After 6 months my payments had brought my balance down to {$810.00}. Then the FIRST statement after the 6 months were up came back with a whopping {$130.00} interest charge on purchases. Bringing my balance to {$940.00}. Almost back up to what I initially owed before payments. First of all the pamphlet said the first 6 months were interest free. So either this company was overtly lying on their advertising or charged me incorrectly. Either way it is very disingenuous to not be clear to consumers as to what they are signing up for when they sign up for this card and outright predatory to do this to people who are in need of medical care for themselves or their pets.

My expectation was that this would follow the normal process, and the excess would be applied to principal. Instead, JGW took the excess, and considered it a forward payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon seeing the mistake on their website, I contacted them, and was assured that the mistake would be corrected. It was not, and 4 more  contacts were made in XX/XX/XXXX, and in each instance, I was assured that the problem would be corrected. On XX/XX/19, I was told that their computer system was incapable of making this change, and that they could not correct the error. 

Although this may seem like a minor problem, please note that I made several principle payments in XX/XX/XXXX, and my monthly interest cost has dropped from {$1300.00} to {$900.00}, so XXXX is awarding themselves {$400.00} for their incompetence.

I am writing to plead for assistance from The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and ask for a thorough investigation with American Express, as they are condoning, disregarding and quite frankly encouraging fraudulent behaviors from their vendors/merchants. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my American Express credit card was charges 11 times for a total amount of {$8800.00} from a merchant named XXXX XXXX. I only authorized/signed for 2 charges - {$190.00} and {$1000.00}. I contacted American Express immediately once I noticed the pending charges. In speaking to the agent/representative, we were convinced the charges were an error as there were numerous and duplicate charges minutes apart from each other. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, all the charges posted and I immediately contacted American Express. The agent explained to me that they will open a billing dispute/inquiry with the merchant and made me feel comfortable that the charges are inaccurate and AMEX will get to the bottom of it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email with an AMEX Message. The message was a note from the merchant stating that I am a regular customer and a copy of 5 out of 11 receipts. I have never been to this establishment prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I reviewed the receipts and noticed my signature was forged on 4 of the 5 receipts ( the {$190.00} receipt being the only one I signed/authorized ). I did not authorized nor was I aware of the 4 other receipts. None of the descriptions on the receipts decipherable. Once again I immediately contacted AMEX, and explained them the charges were fraudulent and my signature was forged. They transferred me to the Fraud department and I was assured that AMEX is going to initiate a thorough investigation. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called AMEX looking for a status update and an update on the remaining receipts. The agent/representative explained to me the investigation is still pending and they have not received the additional receipts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I returned a call to the Fraud department as they left me a voicemail. The agent/representative from the Fraud dept. explained to me that the fraud team will not investigate this case because I was present at the establishment with the card. The agent/representative requested I contact customer care to continue to investigate the case. I did not understand how this is not fraud as I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged. I was told by the agent on XX/XX/XXXX that this was fraud and she transferred me to the fraud team. If this is not fraud I do not know what is Either way, I then contacted customer care again and the agent/representative explained to me that there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route. I was so devastated and disappointed with the agent/representative approach and response that I had to end the phone call. I took some time to compose myself from the disappointing way the previous agent/representative address the situation. I called back a few hours later and requested to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor ( XXXX ) came on the line and immediately repeated the same message the previous agent/representative provide me ( there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route ) without listening to my concerns. I explained to her that I do not feel this was handled accordingly from AMEX from the very beginning. 
i.e. 
How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other There are 4 separate cases/inquires open and the agent/representative could not explain why 4 were open vs 1. They could also not explained why 1 was closed out the other 3 were still open nor can I decipher why The agent/representative agreed this was fraud and transferred me to the Fraud dept., the Fraud dept. did not even investigate the case even though I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged The agents/representatives and supervisor could not provide me any updates on the case or updates on the remaining receipts on every call I made to customer care.

There was a credit on my account for {$1100.00} ( {$390.00}, {$290.00}, {$290.00} and {$190.00} ). Two agent/representative could not explain the credit and the supervisor ( XXXX ) stated the credit was from the merchant b/c of the duplicated charges. Shortly after this was explained to me, I receive an email stating the credit is being reversed. 
Communication and updates have been poor and inadequate The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) At this point, I contacted and engaged the District Attorneys office to notify them of the fraud and unjust business practice from this merchant. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I send an email to a member of the American Express Leadership team, to express my concerns on how American Express has managed and addressed the investigation/matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from an American Express Executive Assistant, stating they have received my email and are reviewing my inquires and concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the same American Express Executive Assistant, with an attached resolution letter stating We have extensively researched your concerns and determined all claims were investigated and correctly decisioned, because of the fact I was present at the establishment. Their outcome of all claims resulted in the following credits : {$1900.00} ( Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code ), {$500.00} ( tip amount from the {$1500.00} charge ), {$400.00} ( tip amount from the {$1100.00} charge ), and {$80.00} ( tip amount from the {$200.00} charge ).

I responded with my concern that this was not thoroughly and extensively reviewed as they stated. And requested a call to discuss the actions and steps that were taken to extensively research my concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to the same American Express Executive Assistant, to review and address my concerns. I ask a number of questions and what steps/process were taken regarding how American Express came to their decision. She was very abrupt and refused to answer specific questions. Her common response was You were at the establishment. I explained to her that their vendor/merchant had possession of my American Express Credit Card for the duration of my stay at their business. During that time span, they processed 11 separate simultaneous charges without my authorization. They then provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. Because I was at the establishments does not mean I authorized the charges. Below are a few of the concern I attempted to discuss with the American Express Executive Assistant to no avail. 
Why was I, nor the vendor/merchant, not physically contacted ( Called ) during the investigation Did American Express review the Merchants history An explanation of the Charges ( I can not decipher the descriptions on the receipts And the merchant would not return my call ) Why certain tips were credited and not others. 
o Her explanation was, any receipt with an X marked on the line for a tip would be credited. 
o There were receipts with X marked on the tip line that were credited and not credited o She stated she will look into why there was inconsistency on American Express 's part with the credit issued for the tips Why was only one charge of {$1900.00} was credited.

o She states the Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code o I requested the purpose and meaning of entering the authorization and she refused to explain it to me.

Why did I not receive all of the requested receipts until weeks/months later from American Express ... I requested them numerous times and they finally provided 10 out of the 11 receipts to me in batches when they clearly had all of them from the beginning. ( I am still missing 1 receipt including the receipt I signed for {$1000.00} ) I received endless inconsistency with the credits provided. I was provided numerous credits on separate occasions and then the credits were removed on separate occasions. As a matter of fact, shortly after my call with the American Express Executive Assistant, where she went through and confirmed my credits, I received notice the same credit is being removed.

Inconsistent messaging form American Express employees o The numerous/separate cases caused inconsistent responses/messages from the customer care agents every time I called in. The Communication and updates were poor and inadequate. Each Customer Care Agents provided me a different and inaccurate update or were not able to provide me any updates at all.

The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other, while the vendor/merchant had possession of my Credit Card. They provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. 


I am pleading with The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter. The fact that American Express accepts/allows this vendor to provide dishonest business practice and fraud to any patron is unacceptable, disturbing and frightening. How can American Express support, allow and accept this merchant to continue to provide unfair, dishonest and fraudulent business practice in our community?

I ask at the outset of the process for the underwriting guidelines so I knew what to expect and how to fill out the application properly. They wouldn't provide the guidelines, nor would they tell me anything about them. I had to resubmit the P & L 6 separate times with 6 separate reps from the company telling me 6 separate things. In the end they denied it because of an obscure underwriting rule that they never told me about even though I had repeatedly asked them to do so. 

My sense is that they offer these assistance programs with no intention of making good on the program.

09-01-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"My husband died on XX/XX/XXXX, or XX/XX/XXXX. He died in his sleep. At the time of his death he had a home mortgage with Wells Fargo Bank. The property involved here was a property left to him by his mother.So even though we lived there the property was considered separate property. At the time of his death, I was not sure weather he had paid the mortgage so on XX/XX/XXXX I went to a Wells Fargo branch and advised them that my husband had died and I wanted to make sure his mortgage had been paid for the month. I requested that they advise the life events division that he had died. They accepted the payment. I advised that I would bring the death certificate when I received it.When I got the death certificate I went to a branch and gave them a copy of the death certificate, again requesting that it be forwarded to the life events division. I also made the XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment. I also called Wells Fargo and advised that my husband had died and that I was calling about separate property. They would not speak with me because I was not on the loan. I sent them a copy of the death certificate and again requested that someone contact me in reference to me becoming the Successor in Interest on this loan. I continued to make payments until XX/XX/XXXX. When I attempted to make payment in XXXX they advised that they could not take the payment because it was delinquent when he died. I advised that I had been making payments and had requested to be placed on the loan as Successor in Interest. I also advised Wells Fargo that my husband had a minor child when he died and that I was attempting to become his Conservator/guardian so that I could resolve this matter for both our interest in probate court. I again requested the paperwork to begin the Successor in Interest designation. I advised that under Dodd Frank and the CFPB guidance there was NO ability to repay process to become the Successor In Interest. Wells Fargo still would not start the process. I had been in contact with Wells Fargo weekly in reference to the Successor In Interest process. I requested that my request be sent to the legal division because the people I was dealing with did not know what I was referring to. I also gave them the information relating to my stepson 's conservatorship. They sent a letter about reinstating the loan and I advised that this would be included in the Successor in Interest and reminded them that they had refused to take payments from me after XX/XX/XXXX. I again requested to be put on the loan. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice to vacate my home advising that it had been sold on XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any notice of any foreclosure as it related to the property. Nothing came in the mail or was served on the Estate of my husband or to me. I was forced to go to court to stop the eviction. After researching the foreclosure I discovered that the foreclosure had been processed in the name of my deceased Mother in Law. No paperwork appeared in my mailbox relating to my husband! The loan on this case had been in my husbands name since XXXX. It also took him great difficulty to put the loan in his name after his mother 's death. Nothing relating to this loan should have been processed in his Mother 's name after he became the obligatory on the loan. I was forced at great expense to go to Court to stop the eviction. Because I was dealing with Wells Fargo and because of all of the reputational issues relating to the fraud perpetrated against its customers I was able to convince the Judge to dismiss the eviction. I again requested that I be made Successor in Interest. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Wells Fargo advised that they had the legal right to foreclose in my Mother 's in Law name without notice to my husband 's estate or to me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,TX,,,Consent provided,Web,09-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3120873

Actually we are not responsible for the late payment. As per the deal the dealer gave they were supposed to pay the first two payment : the one that you pay during the signing of the lease and the second one which is the one that will be officially billed by the finance department. Dealership forgot and I came to know about this when I went online to pay my bill from XXXX XXXX which I am supposed to pay. The dealership owned up the mistake and paid the one they had to pay. Infiniti finance refused to update the incorrect credit reporting and asked me to submit proofs for all this. I called in created a ticket with customer service and submitted the required docs. Processing time is 6-8 weeks and they don't send you an email with decision you have to keep calling and they will just close it after they make a decision. Since XX/XX/XXXX to this date XX/XX/XXXX I have opened multiple tickets with their customer service. Each time they bring up new issue with the documentations. ie lets say there are five things they wanted in the body of the letter they tell one each time they reject. And finally, one of the customer service agent himself dictated the body of the letter to me so that the dealer can print this in their letter pad and then I can submit it. Now they rejected that also. The dealership clearly states that it was their fault etc but they just will find new issues all the time. As I am typing this the customer service agent I am working with is trying to come up with new wording to cater towards the new rejection reasons from infiniti finance. They are just so painful and so irresponsible. I am not sure why they have to do this even when their own customer service agents says they can not figure the reason why they keep rejecting the letter or the plea to correct the incorrect credit reporting. 

Now latest rejection reason which they didn't tell when they rejected before is that they want the dealership to put in the letter why they made a late payment and why they are agreeing to pay it on my behalf. 

Similar is my experience with another ticket I have with them. I got a parking ticket and I paid on time. They paid it again after I paid it without consulting me. And now they have not recouped the money from the city for months now and I will have to pay the same amount again to infiniti. 

Their investigation takes more than 30 days, I am not being notified of the results, there is difficulty submitting or get details of a dispute etc. I need somebody to help me. They make you feel helpless. Because of this incorrect reporting I got rejected for my wife 's student loan refinancing and finally when we got a refinancing we got a lower rate than we should have as because of all this my credit score went down from 800s to lower 700s.",,NISSAN MOTOR ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION,MA,018XX,,Consent provided,Web,31-05-2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3260102

On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the balance in full ( {$3200.00} ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I was assessed an interest charge of {$40.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One customer service to inquire about the interest charge since I had paid the balance in full by the due date. The first person I spoke to said she could not determine why I got the charge and then consulted with someone else. One hour later ( put on hold numerous times ), the other person told me that interest was charged from the time the statement came out ( XX/XX/XXXX ) until the day it was paid off ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I then asked what the purpose of the due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) was if interest was going to be charged from the day the statement was sent and not the due date. The rep said I had been under a 0 % interest rate for 12 months but the promo expired on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked how I would've known that interest would've started accumulating that day and not after the due date as it is with most companies?? She advised it should have been in the welcome packet I received in XX/XX/XXXX ( over a year ago ) when I opened the account ; she said they don't provide any notifications on the statements. She refused to remove the interest charge and when I asked to speak to someone else regarding the issue, I was advised I would have to call back and get someone else. I then called back and asked for a supervisor again who also refused to remove the interest charge. I explained I thought it was a deceptive business practice to begin charging interest on the date the statement was sent and not after the due date. I then requested to close my account if that is the way the company operates and is unwilling to credit an interest charge ( that should've never been applied ) for a good customer. They promptly closed my account without trying to retain me. I do not think it is fair for me to have to pay the interest charge and am requesting it be removed. I would've paid the balance in full on the day I received the statement if it was stated that I needed to. I never pay interest fees on any card. I feel the way they are handling this promo and interest rate period is very deceptive and an easy way to get unsuspecting customers to pay an interest charge as soon as the promo ends.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,,,Consent provided,Web,16-07-2019,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3307446

07-01-2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"During several dates, I have sent certified mail to the credit bureaus asking them to verify the inaccuracies of the information on the bankruptcy they are reporting. On my report, it lists the liabilities and assets being {$0.00}. This is not accurate and you can see this highlighted on the report attached. On several dates, I received the response from the bureau stating they verified the information. I then sent a letter to the XXXX County Court Clerk 's office asking if they verified the information to the bureaus. They sent me a letter stating that they do not provide information to the bureaus. The XXXX creditor was sent a letter for verification and validation and they have not responded to my request and have exceeded the mandatory 30 day time limit. XXXX XXXX was also contacted and has not sent verification. 

My complaint is this, I challenged the Items based upon the inaccurate reporting of the {$0.00} assets and {$0.00} Liabilities on my report for the BK. Pertaining to the XXXX account, they have not responded to certified mail and confirmed verification and validation of their inaccurate reporting. The XXXX XXXX account jumps instantly into 60 day late reporting mark but does not say a 30 day period was breached. I have also added proof that these bureaus are not doing a true verification and supplying relevant proof while not flippantly dismissing the FCRA mandated rules. The bureaus also refuse to provide and form of evidence there for proving their verification. The Bureaus claimed that they had verified the information, when clearly they could not have for two reasons for the BK, 1 ) it is impossible to have a bankruptcy and  have {$0.00} liabilities and {$0.00} assets reported 2 ) the bureaus claimed they verified the information, yet the source of the information sent me a letter that they do not verify information with the courts. Also, I put a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX report yet they used that agency ( NO third party can verify per FCRA ) as a third party. 

This leads me to conclude that the credit bureaus never conducted a reasonable investigation on this inaccurate information for the BK. For the Rise account they have not responded to my request for validation and verification and time has lapsed past 30 days. 

In my certified mail I also requested they remove any inquiries that are not currently associated to any account. The credit bureaus also said they verified the information but can't provide any proof. If they do have proof they have not provided that to me after many requests. 

I would like to have this inaccurate records removed from my credit report as it is reporting inaccurately and incomplete on my report.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,761XX,,Consent provided,Web,07-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3118498

Wells Fargo continues to send unwanted XXXX notifications in delaying and distracting from answering the questions posed to this criminal company in their violations of federal regulatory law as well as criminal law concerning the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and various other regulatory violations as well as criminal fraud and money laundering. They distract and delay answering these questions as it will expose their criminal activity and the activity of Wachovia Bank in 2007 when banks were making windfalls on refinance loans disregarding rules and regulations, competence in transactions by their employees, and fraud to the American consumer. By the shear volume of these refinances and the money that was made, these banks exposed themselves to their shoddy workmanship and to remedy blamed the customers for their mistakes. 

Questions were : 1 ) Why did Wells Fargo sue my person when their acquired bank made the mistake in not requiring a XXXX   balance HELOC not be closed prior to closing knowing the account existed as reported on the credit report and by customer that it existed. Customer paid {$380.00} for that credit report and is the responsibility of the lender to underwrite such disclosure? 2 ) Why did Wells Fargo not notify attorneys of borrower and defendant in their lawsuit against borrower that they dropped their frivolous lawsuit and sold the mortgage to XXXX XXXX as required by federal law? 

Wells Fargo is deliberately trying to confuse and deflect their liability, both civil and criminal, by delaying and reiterating their false narrative to the CFPB and the OCC.

25-01-2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Chase Bank notifying me that an unauthorized purchase with my Chase Credit Card was made at a XXXX XXXX Store ( # XXXX ) for the amount of {$1600.00} and {$2100.00} ( a total {$3800.00} ). Then and there I realized I have lost my Credit Card. 

I immediately denied making any purchase at any XXXX XXXX Store that day. I was later informed that Chase 's Fraud Department will investigate to determine the validity of the charges. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter informing me that, after a "" thorough '' investigation, Chase 's Fraud Department determined that the transactions were valid. Thereafter, I called and spoke with the representative who was in charge of investigating my case. I was informed that because my Credit Card has a chip, and that chip was used for the purchase, then necessarily I must have been the one to  make the purchase! 

Again, I told her I did not make the purchase. Someone who wrongfully took possession of my Credit Card used the card without my authorization, and in the process of said unauthorized use, he or she must have used the chip on the card to make the transactions. How that means that I must have been the one to make the purchases is completely without basis. 

I asked her whether or not she made any attempts to obtain the video surveillance at the XXXX XXXX store in question -- because certainly it will be unequivocal proof that the purchases were made by someone other than me. To which the representative responds that I am the one who is supposed to do so. 

Right after, I attempted to contact the XXXX XXXX store in question. I was told I needed to contact their corporate office 's fraud department, to which they transferred me to. The corporate office then told me that they can not release any videos without the order number of the purchases. Of course, I certainly don't have the order number -- I was not the one to make the purchase, and, therefore, I do not have the receipt or any information as to those purchases. In fact, it's clear that XXXX XXXX was in a better position to obtain the order number than I was -- after all, it's their store and they are the ones to keep records of transactions. 

It is clear Chase 's Fraud Department did not make the alleged "" thorough '' investigation. It would appear that all the representative did was make sure that the Credit Card chip was used to make the purchase. This entire dispute revolves around the fact that someone else has possession of my card. He or she will and has undoubtedly used the Credit Card chip to make the purchase. Just because the transactions were made with the Credit Card chip in no way represents that it was made by me, especially given the circumstances that I did not have possession of the Credit Card.

13-07-2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I applied for and received federal student loans while I was in medical school. I made every payment on time and consistently renewed my income-driven repayment plan yearly, on time and without issue. In XX/XX/XXXX, the due date on my income-driven repayment plan lapsed because I had not received an email alerting me of the yearly requirement for renewal. Upon receiving an email on XX/XX/XXXX that there was an action required on my account, I logged in to find that, because I had not submitted the income-driven plan renewal, ( 1 ) the entire outstanding interest on my loans had capitalized ( + {$19000.00} ) increasing my principal balance by ~10 % and ( 2 ) my monthly loan payment had quadrupled ( to ~ {$2100.00} ). 

I also found that I had been sent -- electronically -- one single notification on XX/XX/XXXX to renew my income-driven plan. However, the email alerting me that I had an action pending on my account was not sent. Moreover, I received no other alerts from FedLoan servicing that I needed to renew my income driven plan. Instead, on XX/XX/XXXX, the above occurred. 

I called FedLoan Servicing several times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the matter. I was forced to submit a one-time forbearance on my XX/XX/XXXX payment because it was ~ {$2100.00}, and I could not afford it. I was encouraged by a supervisor at FedLoan servicing to submit a letter explaining the above described circumstances in order to trigger an investigation and to revert the principal to its prior balance. I was told to expect a response in 2-3 months. 

It has been 6 months since my submission and despite two other calls to the company over that time period, I have not heard a response. 

I have been consistent and timely throughout the life of my loan. I have paid every payment required of me over the life of the loan and I had renewed my income-driven plan without lapse as well. This was an unfortunate event, not consistent with my prior character, that has cost me a 10 % increase in my principal balance and will cost me tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. Also, despite the costly nature forgetting to renew my income-driven plan, I only received one notification from the company to perform this task. I formally disputed the capitalization in a timely fashion ( within days of being notified, on XX/XX/XXXX ) and have not heard back.",,AES/PHEAA,CA,,,Consent provided,Web,13-07-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3305331

28-06-2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"This is the second time Ive been violated by Capital One in the past 2.5 years. I am praying that, as the first matter was resolved satisfactorily, I also hope this matter too can be rectified. I've been a loyal Capital One cardholder, on and off, for over 12 years. I was very surprised on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX to learn that one ( 1 ) of my active capital one credit card accounts were suddenly placed on restriction and are now in the process of being closed due to inactivity. After speaking to the customer service representative, and an escalations manager, ( XXXX in Tampa ) I was informed that because my account was closed on XXXX XXXX that attempting to have the account reopened was too far beyond the redemptive period. This was disheartening to hear considering the email I just received said the account was restricted and would be closed on XX/XX/XXXX. Meaning it was not closed yet. To add injury to insult, her telling me the account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX was the first time I had ever even heard of this. I was never alerted to anything prior to me receiving an email on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. The representative in Tampa asked for my mailing address in which I provided and said I should have received a letter stating my account was closing. To this date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I have not received anything from Capital One except for the email I received on the morning of the XX/XX/XXXX. This was really a harsh stance coming from Capital One considering that, Ive never missed a payment on any of my Capital One accounts in over 10 years, and also that I was never warned that I would be in jeopardy of losing the account due to its inactivity. If I would have been made aware beforehand, I wouldve gladly utilized this account .Not only to prevent a forced closure from occurring, but to also protect my credit profile. I am really worried how my credit is going be affected by this, as my available credit is going to be reduced significantly. Maintaining my credit rating is of utmost importance to me as some of the treatments I received are financed. Because of this, any substantial drop in credit score can affect my ability to finance my treatments/and or cost me more in interest to maintain the same level of service Ive been receiving. Closing this card could potentially create a financial hardship for me. As I think back to the previous experience I had with Capital One, although it was resolved, this created a fear within me ( of them closing my accounts ) of adding authorized users back to my cards. And by me not utilizing this option, I feel this was a precursor to me not having the activity I needed to keep this account open. I am ok with Capital One meeting their business requirements, and making account adjustments when they are required, but in my case I was never alerted to ANYTHING. I bank with other financial institutions and have encountered situations like this before in the past, but never have I been treated so harshly and unfairly, especially without recourse. After being loyal to Capital One for so long, and being a responsible cardholder, I truly hope and pray they will make an exception regarding their inactivity policy, and reconsider their actions and reopen my account.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CA,925XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,28-06-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3290690

I also suspect that this servicer has falsified their service records as now my account seems to show different information according to the customer service reps that service the account when I contact them.

I insisted that I had opted out of overdraft protection on Debit Charges and the statement clearly showed there was a positive balance after the check cleared. The agent continued to argue and interrupt me. He denied that Debit Card transactions on opt out accounts were legally exempt from Overdraft Fees. I reminded them of all the fraudulent activity WF was in the news for again, and that now they were stealing from me. He agreed to waive half of the fee and stated that was all the system would allow him to do. I told him that was unacceptable for them to steal any money from me under the guise of Overdraft Charges for a check that did not bounce. He told me I would have to talk to someone higher up and I insisted he transfer me immediately. 

The next person came on the phone and the situation repeated itself, only this time he offered me an additional 15 % discount on the charges and that was all the system would allow him to do.

One of the conditions, was a completed divorce decree which unfortunately didn't get finalized until XX/XX/XXXX. I have since reached out to the new company that my loan was sold to Select Portfolio Servicing to complete the process I had started with XXXX. They are telling me they have no way to take my ex-wife off the mortgage except for a refinance. The problem with that is I am about {$450000.00} still under water so that is impossible, which they are fully aware of. I was told that when my mortgage was sold, my terms wouldn't change which to me at least means I am not put in a worse situation as I didn't choose them ( SPS ) they bought my loan without my consent so why should this option no longer be available to me? I feel they need to make good on the process I was going through with XXXX since it wasn't my choice to work with them they chose me.

I was told that I didn't need to because we should have a decision on the conversion before the fee becomes late. The next letter I get is that a XXXX dollar late fee has been applied to my XXXX dollar fee and I am now in collection. The day I get the letter I contacted US Bank and they admitted that there was a snafu and after I made the payment for the XXXX dollar fee and XXXX dollar late fee I was credited back for both fees plus an additional account credit. It was also at this time that I learned that after all of the additional information given to authorize running my credit, it was never processed to have the account converted. In XX/XX/XXXX I get a notification of a 30-90 day late now appears on my credit from this account and this XXXX dollar fee. I have now contacted US Bank 4+ times I am told that there is nothing they can do, I am responsible, I am deserving of this, and if I don't like it to dispute it on my credit or send a letter. I have tried to get to the executive office or a higher up office, I am told that I am not permitted to talk to anyone other than credit card service. I have now disputed the late on my credit. This bank is ruining my life. Oh, and to close my account I have to send in a fax or letter which they claim that was sent in and I had not at that point sent in a letter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,CA,941XX,,Consent provided,Web,20-02-2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3158479

I am upset that Synchrony Bank took extreme measures to ruin my credit, including not contacting me regarding the one late payment that I had on my account. 
Currently, my credit report is reflecting one 30-day delinquency for XX/XX/XXXX and one 60-day delinquency for XXXX of XXXX on this account. I am not disputing the late payment in itself, but I am very upset that Synchrony would not take the time to understand my circumstances and assist me with this matter. 
I opened a XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX card in XX/XX/XXXX. I consistently made my minimum payments each month. In XX/XX/XXXX, Synchrony urged me to enroll in paperless billing and I did. I have consistently had both a monthly {$5.00} recurring charge and corresponding {$5.00} auto-draft payment take place on the account with minimal usage otherwise. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$33.00} purchase that I forgot I charged to my XXXX  XXXX account and did not increase my automatic payment to cover this purchase. Synchrony assessed multiple late payments which caused this {$33.00} purchase to grow into a {$140.00} balance. In XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my credit report and only then realized that this account was delinquent. 

Synchrony Bank has all my contact information on file ( address, phone, email ) but never contacted me regarding this past due balance. According to the Synchrony representative that I spoke to, because I was continuing to make a {$5.00} auto payment each month and was therefore making monthly payments, Synchrony had no obligation to send me a notice. 
I immediately called Synchrony customer service line and explained the situation to a supervisor named XXXX in the XXXX, OH call center. She took all my information and promised that I would receive a response within 30 business days. That call took place on XX/XX/XXXX. To this day I have not received any contact or correspondence from Synchrony replying to my inquiry. 
This has ruined my credit and caused me immense mental and physical stress. As a loyal Synchrony customer who paid her bill on time each month, I do not believe that Synchrony should continue to cause me such mental stress and ruin my credit. Lenders such as Synchrony should not be allowed to prey on unsuspecting customers, ruin their credit and then refuse to provide them with good customer service. I request that any outstanding balance be waived and this tradeline either be removed from my credit report or be updated to show as never past due.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,GA,300XX,,Consent provided,Web,05-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3170649

However, during XX/XX/XXXX i received a phone call stating that the program that i agreed to was not the right one any longer so I had to complete the over the phone process again and agree to terms. I then received a phone call in XX/XX/XXXX stating that the program was not the correct program again and I had to do the entire agreement over the phone again. In XX/XX/XXXX I received another phone call stating that I was not in the correct program although payments were still being automatically taken out of my account. I was apprehensive about these phone calls as it seemed every month i was getting a call stating that it was the wrong program, so I waited to see if another payment was going to be drafted as it in fact was. I believed that since payments were coming out, that I was still in the program and i did not receive anything in writing stating otherwise. I then finally received a letter in the mail in XX/XX/XXXX stating that I was now in default and the balance was due of XXXX. The entire time payments were being made and I agreed to the program they advised me on. I don't think it is fair and practical to call three months  straight saying I was in the wrong program although i agreed to the terms and made payments. I need help getting out of the default status and I believe the burden should be on them as they gave me wrong advice and stated that I was in a program for repayment. Thank you! I plan to call again to try and resolve this, however, they are not being as understanding as they should.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",VA,222XX,,Consent provided,Web,25-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3161881

Mr . XXXX further processed my application. During this process, and procedure all information was again verified and approved before submitting the verifications of reserves funds with the under writer department. Remember in the beginning, I was already verified for having {$1700.00} in reserves which was required, however the underwriter department requested {$30000.00}. Now this seem strange and all of sudden, I asked XXXX XXXX to have underwriter to go over their numbers again because I knew the amount was {$17000.00}, which they did. The next day, it was confirmed {$17000.00}. Well this brought red flags with me in believing they was not processing my application fairly. Then the underwriters department asked to verified my reserves which I used the information which Mr. XXXX used, my bank savings accounts, my XXXX XXXX   investment plan as well as my XXXX XXXX account. Underwriters came back and said they could not use the XXXX  account nor the XXXX XXXX account, stating they do not grant credit to any terms and conditions requested. The terms and condition they were talking about is the disclosure statement showing that I am the account Holder irregardless of others on the account and if I ever needed the funds I would be penalized for 10 % plus State and Federal Tax prematurely which would not have an affect on them just me. This is standard on any IRA, Roth, retirement savings etc. They opted for this, without stating the guidelines under XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, to justify. So I researched the Guidelines, and it stated funds that can not be withdrawn under circumstances owners retirement, employment termination, or death can not be counted as part of the borrowers reserves. Their guidelines listed whats acceptable source of reserves and Unacceptable source of reserves. In orders words the XXXX investment plan can be used and they decided on their own not to. Unacceptable. Retraining is needed here. 

Further, I have been with this company for many years and they handled two of my loans if a company, cant satisfy their customers fairly then customers dont need their servicing because of unfair practices. I hereby request an investigation into PHH mortgage Loan process particularly their underwriters department in processing refinance loans and the reserves verification.",,PHH Mortgage Services Corporation,MD,207XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,27-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3164848

He was paid in full XXXX. He quiet on week prior of the date resolution was expected ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Resolution was to take place on XX/XX/XXXX. The company did not complete the work and the research was done incorrectly ( supporting documents submitted to dispute dept. XX/XX/XXXX ). I filed a disput with my credit card company that I used to pay the fees, Barclay Bank of Delaware. The dispute was filed in XX/XX/XXXX. I never received correspondence advising of the results. I contacted the dispute department on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed the dispute was closed and charges of {$5500.00} had been placed back onto my account. I was informed I had the right to reopen the disputed charge. I informed the representative that I would not have the results until the issue is closed which was scheduled for late XX/XX/XXXX. She informed me shewas resend the letter via email, refused to email or fax the letter to me, she was reminded the issue would not be resolved until end of XX/XX/XXXX, which she acknowledged and stated to resubmit my dispute as soon as the issue was resolved and to fax the dispute. There was no mention of a timeline ro submit my resipute. The issue was resolved XX/XX/XXXX and documents where ready for reproduction until after XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted a fax to disput department on XX/XX/XXXX, that included the issue resolution results, billing from the company that demonstrates large amount of hours charged for research that failed at resolution. 
Prior to submitting supporting documents I called many times between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, inm effort to have the disput reopened. Every time I called I was informed only a dispute manager can help me and they would have one call me within 24-48 hours. This has been the answer since XX/XX/XXXX. Not till XX/XX/XXXX was I able to speak to a dispute manager. The disput manager informed me that my dispute would not be reopened because I missed the 10 day deadline. In every call I made I was never informed that I only had 10 days from the date of the letter was mailed to reopen my dispute. In every phone call I was given step by step guidance on how to reopen my dispute. The customer service representative knew that the issue would not be resolved until after XX/XX/XXXX. The representatives did not say that was a problem nor did they explain any deadlines I had to comply with. I did everything that was asked of me. I called again in early XX/XX/XXXX, multiple time from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. Each time I was informed only a manager in the dispute department could help me but they would have to call me back within 24-48 hours. I never received any calls. The customer service representatives and dispute managers gave me wrong information and are now refusing to reopen the dispute and accept responsibility for their mistakes. I was never told over the phone I has a date I had to reply be, I have not received any correspondence from the bank and I was given wrong information by several different employees. Their guidance was incorrect, according to the last dispute manager I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX. He also refused to reopen the dispute, that a decision had been made and the next step is to send a letter to the Presendent of the Bank.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,CO,800XX,,Consent provided,Web,05-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3166409
