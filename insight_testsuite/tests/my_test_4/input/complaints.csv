Well, of course I cant provide any documentation because none exists! I do not know these companies. The credit bureaus are not monitoring our credit, they are holding it hostage and refusing to remove invalid items. They will respond to you that they have acted within the their legal rights or something, but they will not resolve the situation. As a business owner, this is a big deal to me and has already cost our company a time sensitive chance for expansion that was worth millions, all because they cant keep their servers secure and expect me, a consumer, to provide documentation to correct their errors. But they sure want to charge us to view our own credit profile. The entire system is a joke and is not designed to help correct errors on credit profiles.

16-01-2020,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",PA,,,Consent provided,Web,16-01-2020,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3498924

This unconfirmed, unverified, and dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy has stopped me from obtaining credit. I know for a fact your company receives information on bankruptcy from a third party system known as a XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX is inaccurate and incomplete since the XXXX XXXX does not provide complete social security numbers as that would be against the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy Laws. Furthermore, I have been in contact with the county courthouse and they also assured me they do not report full social security numbers to thirty parties or make social security numbers public record. Even though it is your company 's policy to keep reporting a bankruptcy that is filed, dismissed, or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681 ( c ) relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law is very clear and states from the date of adjudication or date of order of relief. 

Any case, whether it be civil or otherwise, once dismissed it no longer exists in the eyes of the law. This case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. You have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed non-existent. It is only fair that in accordance with section 1618 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act you delete this from my credit report and send me an updated copy.

Considering this does not require an investigation, I would appreciate an updated copy of my credit report showing no bankruptcy within two weeks from the date you receive this letter.

Attached is a copy of my most recent mortgage statement dated XX/XX/2019 which references a reinstatement amount. ( Attached - PDF Reference 1 ) I have the ability and am prepared to make such payment in a single installment to being this loan current, although such action requires an updated quote from you. ( Attached PDF - Reference 2 ) Additionally, the mortgage statement makes reference that this amount consists of unpaid advance disbursements but does not fully itemize these amounts. ( Attached PDF - Reference 3 ) This property was subject of a foreclosure sale by Sale Committee on XX/XX/2019, although the report of the Committee has not been marked for judicial consideration ( potential approval ) until XX/XX/2019. 

Finally, there appear to be irregularities in the conduct of your legal counsel within this process with respect to Connecticut General Statue 49-31s regarding the concurrent filing of motions for default and judgment upon non-appearing parties. 

Such concurrent filings might be permitted for instances of abandoned or unoccupied residential buildings, however despite the repeated placement of "" XXXX - Vacant '' stickers on an accessory ( storage/garage ) building on the property, there seems to exist no other evidence or rationale to think that this single family home actively occupied by the mortgagor ( me ) had somehow become abandoned property. 

Given the deficiencies in service and process upon me which resulted from this ( apparently ) erroneous application of the accelerated timeline, I ask for ability to reinstate this loan and request such calculation of the reinstatement payment amount in accordance with Connecticut General Statue 49-10a. 

Such payment would be made direct to your organization in single installment within 3 business days of receipt.

I did not know who this was r what it was for. The name listed was XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) I looked them up and called them on the phone. They informed me that the Original Creditor was XXXX. They said that the bill was from XX/XX/2013 but could not tell me what the phone number was attached to the bill. I then explained to them that I have been a XXXX customer in good standing for over 15 years and that my monthly payments are automatically deducted from my bank account, and that this wasnt my bill. 

I questioned them as to how they could put this on my credit report without ever sending me a bill. They couldnt answer that question. The person I spoke said that they would send me out a form to dispute the bill. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX with a form included to file a fraud complainant with XXXX. I had never once said that fraud had been committed. I then took this information and went to XXXX and had them look up the account in question. They informed me that there was no record of the account other than that it was turned over to XXXX. XXXX informed me that XXXX had all of the documentation associated with the account in question. 
When I spoke with a representative at XXXX they informed me that they had nothing either, just that they had bought the debt from somewhere. Since I got nowhere with XXXX or XXXX I filed a dispute through all three credit reporting agencies. They all came back that the account was valid. 

I have never received anything from this company ( XXXX  ) no bills no statements nothing. I am at a loss as to how a company can put something on your credit report without validating the debt, even when I spoke with them on the phone they had nothing to establish that the debt was mine. I had a credit score of over 750 before they added this account, by adding this they dropped my score by 85 points which was very damaging to my credit. I am not sure how they can do that.

20-09-2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,,,Consent provided,Web,20-09-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3380692

The company has never made any mention of any amount specifically, however, I continued to receive more phone calls from this company. It became so bad that the company not only used the phone number listed initially, but retained several other numbers in order to continue to harass me, threatening me with legal actions. The additional phone numbers that were associated with the company are : XXXX and XXXX. 

From the phone number XXXX are the dates and times recorded by my phone call log : XX/XX/2018 Beginning on XXXX XX/XX/2018 The company called me every single day during the dates listed above. The number of calls received in total is : 135 times ( average calls per day were 5ea ) I have made the following attempts to contact this company. I have made screen clips of every way that I have reached out to this company, via email phone conversation, in order to inform them to cease and desist from communications with me. First, I called the company to let them know to cease and desist contact with me. I am unsure as to the date. I did however, go onto Monarch Recovery website provided. I wanted to ensure that they understood the reason that I was reaching out to them. So in order to ensure that I was able to somehow get proof that I made contact with the company. So, I utilized the chat option so that the communication could be captured to have proof that I specifically made contact with a representative from the company. Finally, I sent an email to the email address specifically included within the many correspondence that I continued to receive via US postal. Additionally, I also have recordings of the conversations between myself and the representatives from this company. 

I have all the images saved and to uploaded to my phone in order to provide proof that this company harassed me continuously over almost a 5-6 month period, the few times that I did answer the phone calls, I was once cursed out by a representative, another time the conversation between myself and the representative became so aggressive and threatening, simply from because of a statement the representative made regarding about my XXXX XXXX health. I insistently told him that, due to intensity of our conversation continuing to become more aggressive, I needed to get off the phone call with him. His reply was, I completely understand what you are going through, but you need to resolve this issue and stop using time I spent in the military as a an excuse to not pay this debt that I owed. He went on say that my XXXX   state could not in fact be that bad.

17-03-2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Public record information inaccurate,"My husband and I were trying to refinance our home in XXXX, XXXX when we were made aware of an issue on our Equifax report. Our Equifax report listed two bankruptcies ; one in XXXX of XXXX filed with a local court, a true bankruptcy that we did indeed file, and another in XXXX with the same filing number, information, etc. but filed in a different court in a city we had never visited. We of course tried to contact Equifax regarding this information. They did update our credit report, but still listed both bankruptcies with the same filing information. The only thing they changed was the date. Both bankruptcies now have the same true date of filing, but show different counties. This of course has caused issues for us in terms of refinancing as it now looks like we have two bankruptcies on our history. I tried to contact the court at the number Equifax used to "" verify '' the information. The number, XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, is not in service. I actually called this exact number a second time while on the phone with an Equifax representative trying to prove that there was no way they used that phone number to verify the incorrect information and was told "" I should look for another number ''. I further asked how else they were able to contact to verify the information, and they only gave me a physical address. I asked them again how else they were able to verify the information, as I knew they did not personally visit the location, and I was told to look for another contact number. 

I did some research on the secondary filing location of XXXX County. This bankruptcy court has been closed since XXXX, a year before we actually even filed for bankruptcy ( XXXX ), and 3 years before Equifax accepted a new filing from that address ( XXXX ). Upon further investigation and reaching out to people to help, we have learned that this is a very common issue with Equifax. I have emails from a clerk of courts that state that numerous people have had the same issue with Equifax claiming this closed court as a viable entity and accepting bankruptcies from this court address. 

I have spent countless hours on the phone trying to get this fixed. It has been suggested by Equifax representatives and per their advertising while on hold, that we pay for a credit repair service to help us correct this issue. I even had an online message via XXXX messenger from XXXX XXXX stating that a senior representative would be contacting me. This message was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and I have yet to receive any additional contact. I do continue to receive emails that my claim has been looked at, but can no longer login to my Equifax account because my personal information, the same information I use to contact a representative live, does not match their records. I have, of course, called and the only resolution they have come to is that they verified the false bankruptcy court and changed the date of filing. 

I feel like this has been an ongoing issue for consumers like me. The fact that this bankruptcy court has been closed for 6 years and that Equifax is allowing "" verified reports '' from it, is ridiculous. Additionally, the fact that they could not actually give me anyway in which they truly "" verified '' the information, other than a disconnected phone number is VERY disturbing. Our credit is being held hostage and we have no way to negate what Equifax is reporting. Also, the fact that it was constantly suggested via their advertising and through their own agents that we should go through their "" preferred partner '', XXXX, further incites me, as people should not have to pay to have fraudulent/unverifiable information removed from THEIR personal credit report.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NC,27592,,Consent provided,Web,18-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3182509

This is the third time this has happened in 2 years. I send the servicing folks emails and call and then get a reply they have 30 days to get back to me and dont. 

This started in XX/XX/XXXX when Selene finance took over my Mortgage payment. Selene Finance wrote I was behind 90 days and if I didnt pay they would foreclose on my home. 

However the previous lender received XXXX for property taxes, mortgage payments in XXXX. In the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Selene finance said I had to take it up with that company this is what I owed. So I did pay them all the payments. But because I had waited on trying to get the funds placed property I was assessed "" property Assessment '' of XXXX to XXXX charges every week. 

After I paid the 90 days of payments and excessive fees I signed the mortgage contracts to have ACH withdrawal. However 2 days later I called and stopped the ACH withdrawal from XXXX and then I called and places stop payments for the ACH withdrawals. I was nervous the payments would not be placed correctly since I was over paying to go to interest. 

Unfortunately Selene finance Did not stop the ACH withdrawal so I did at my bank. This caused all the OD fees that were not OD fees but cancelled ACH pulls. Selene would auto pay my account it gets rejected as a stop payment and I get tagged XXXX they then would pull again the next day same thing XXXX in fees rejected. 

My Bill pay checks would put on the account with the extra funds to go to OD fees or property assessment fees. Instead of to interest. 

I would call, Selene customer Service phone person, would say resubmit I would, then I would get charges XXXX for each Bank charge from them saying NSF when it was not NSF but they sent back. I have times I called, who I spoke with including follow-up emails. After 6 months of this I finally was able to get a hold of a supervisor who went thru the account with me reversed the XXXX od fees places the extra payments correctly and revered the XXXX property assessment fees. 

All goes well until XXXX of XXXX when check was sent back, attached ... 

this was the same practice that caused all the excessive fees again. the supervisor placed the funds correctly. Selene finance kept charging me the XXXX until XXXX. With the customary letter of NSF/ ACH. This came back on XXXX. I resent the Check. Again 2 more XXXX fees for the XXXX stop payments from ACH withdrawal payments thats was cashed by Selene finance. My XXXX payment was cashed with no problem sent as bill pay. and still OD fees.XXXX I call in XXXX, to Selene finance when I receive the letter that my contracts were sold to XXXX XXXX. However XXXX XXXX  says I owe 90 days of payments XXXX XXXX and XXXX. 

I sent my XXXX payment it was sent back. on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent my XXXX payment and it was accepted by XXXX XXXX who know tell me I owe for 6 months of payments plus fees. If I do not pay they will foreclose on my home. 

I have sent to both parties emails showing the copies of the cashed checks to both parties. Yet Selene finance will not contact me. I have asked for mediation on the excess fees and accounting practices Nothing. 

I have all emails and correspondence I have sent to all parties. XXXX XXXX has not had me sign any paperwork for them yet. No mortgage paperwork. 

Please any help would be great. I am concerned they will foreclose on my home..

26-02-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX I made arrangements with the so called Sr. loan officer at Fortren Funding located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX to refinance my mortgage and ever since then I have been complaining because they think their swift in covering up costly numbers for their clients and am fully on to their scheme in robbing innocent families with outstanding credit, then destroy them with phony personnel. It started when XXXX XXXX told me to stop making payments to my current lender at ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX at this point XXXX XXXX  stated to me to let my new LENDER know that they will not pay my taxes for the 1st quarter. I let XXXX know about this and at first it was OK. and after mid month I received a late payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then contacted XXXX and XXXX XXXX another sales manager who went over my documentation to clarify my credit history and sign docs to qualify for the loan and had an XXXX credit score.So I cancelled ... This is when XXXX contacted me and said "" no '' don't cancel because it was only a matter of my tax payment that the title company refused to pay up front for me to start my escrow account. However, we can start the process again the following month because there is still time before my 1st quarter taxes were due and I will submit the same contract again with no closing cost to you and don't worry about the late fee because you are still saving 2 hundred a month to keep your 2nd home. I said "" please put this in writing and e-mail me that info ... and he did so ''. XXXX then instructed a Title company named XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time located in XXXX nj to arrange documentation on what we discussed And when XXXX XXXX arrived to my home on the evening mentioned XX/XX/XXXX she arrived with the HUD and we signed documents together as well as an unpaid hospice bill that appeared under my Dad 's name before he passed away in XXXX and simply had this removed from damaging my credit by notarizing that I was solely XXXX XXXX XXXX not XXXX ... And discussed like XXXX had mentioned to me that "" although he said, "" that there is no additional closing cost..there will be 500.00 from out of pocket expenses for the title agent and other fee if I can come up with XXXX with a cashier 's check to meet the tax deadline, since I will be skipping 2 monthly payments and receiving a disbursement check "" from my old lender ( XXXX XXXX ) for the amount of 1900 and change but not until LATER in XXXX since my old escrow account is being washed. and there we go XXXX stated, I also asked XXXX about the XXXX being the tax deadline and questioned how taxes were being paid and XXXX stated, they had to be escrowed into mortgage account from title company for recording and mentioned that it's a refinance and a few days late will not effect anything maybe a few extra dollars. He also told me to remember that we were brother 's being that were both from the same town 1 mile apart. At this time XXXX told both myself and my girlfriend that this cashier 's check is strictly for my tax payment and nothing else and attached it with the 1st payment letter on the HUD and mentioned again "" for taxes only! '' as she held it up to us. And this is where it does get tricky because the actual contract on the HUD realize is the original contract from when XXXX then XXXX stepped in as the Sr. loan officer to service the majority of this loan, XXXX or known as XXXX started the contract to approve my loan. So being numbers were left the same from the previous month evidently there has been a history of confusion and me and my family had to sacrifice over what XXXX had mentioned was a HUGE mistake and would have this problem handled ASAP for me when I contacted him by XX/XX/XXXX and asked him why only partial payment was made towards my taxes? I contacted him a few weeks later and told him that my taxes were still due but not delinquent and will have to pay on my own since I had a ton of money at that time. XXXX and my township asked why should I if I already escrowed them? And my town stated that they will put a yellow sticker on? XXXX said he checked again and they would be paying them soon. By the following year of XX/XX/XXXX I was receiving odd e-mails about unauthorized payments from my checking account for late payments from XXXX XXXX located over seas where all negative information was recorded to my credit history as well as the unpaid lien that was from my father 's and had to pay numerous penalties and fees for this error. By XX/XX/XXXX my car payment drastically increased along with my mortgage payment costing me an extra cost of living of 300.00 per month with an escrow shortage and canceled credit card. When I contacted XXXX he asked me who paid my taxes? I told him XXXX and he did not say anything but he will get back. I called again and this is when he disconnected his phone. I finally called in XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to anther man XXXX XXXX who I never met and would not know what XXXX and I actually arranged. So he stated that he was taking charge of this loan and took a look at it and asked if this was a no appraisal fee and skipping 2 payments I said yes. he then asked me if I received a disbursement check? I said yes, then XXXX asked what did I do with it? spend it! I said yes towards my 1st 2 voucher payments made to fortren funding in the amount of XXXX when my payments were less than that amount and ended up with an escrow shortage after the 1st analysis came due from the negligence from the originators from what I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX and went directly to a credit service then sold to them delinquent after contacting their ombudsman dept. XXXX then told me it was too late to make any changes and not to have no more contact with them because no one is here to help me except my current lender who ever they were because my loan got all screwed up. By the time it was then sold to XXXX XXXX   my current lender I was and have been facing more escrow shortages, late payments diminished credit score and had to sell my second home and became XXXX because I thought this was a temporary mishap. And having no choice than to pay the losses to avoid losing my primary residence. By the summer of XXXX I was facing XXXX losses and submitting many complaints but the damages at that time were not severe enough for me to pursue and I received a phone call from a third party at Fortren Funding XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX and he told me that XXXX is no longer available to explain how this loan fell out of my favor and would be too costly in court with all of the banks handling my loan and suggested that I request a loan modification where that would reduce my interest another point and any liens that were recorded would be forgotten and that none of these consumer complaints believe me because the XXXX messed up the paperwork. I knew that this was another false misrepresentation so I reported all of this to my current lender. I also did contact other authorities. An experienced Sr.loan officer with my credit history and the HUD presented to them is self explanatory with the 48th month history if examining, the timing of the disbursement check which I was accused of spending towards my taxes ... HUD 1 settlement statement lines XXXX fees XXXX line XXXX taxes ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX with tax certificate showing that taxes were open for XX/XX/XXXX on the evening at closing. And the payoff to my former lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) At this time of course everyone involved has avoided any involvement in this criteria and are probably out there in other offices after closing down. Hopefully this will give a clearer picture how these people who can not maintain their own lives, careers and jobs, families etc.It 's the people who work hard like my father did and I who have outstanding credit and a work history of 39 straight years in the work force until I had to work harder at XXXX years old for what started as a simple mistake.

I already disputed this with the credit bureaus and they verified it as being accurate. I am not sure how this happened, I |thought that I had made my payments to you on time when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me or maybe an error occurred where it wasn't recorded on time. 

I do ask in light of the good standing relationship we have that you remove any late payments from my credit report and refund me any late fees that were added to my account. I do not believe it is accurate. 

I would rather not have to spend more time than necessary for both of us to resolve this situation so I was hoping that instead of escalating anything, that you could help me with this and report me as being 100 % on time. 

I appreciate your help regarding this and look forward to keep having the positive experience that I have had with you in the past.

My dad sometimes wears a XXXX, & is being hated based on his religious beliefs by this branch manager. For over 5 years, monthly he withdraws funds, without any complications. Several months ago he wore XXXX, he forgot to write the amount on the withdrawal slip, & in turn the manager told him "" get out, & come back when you learned how to fill out forms. '' Customer is over 70, XXXX. Old gentleman who forgot to enter in amount. How can he speak to him that way?

She spoke to the manager, & he told her that my dad is being loud in the past, & that's why he doesn't want to give him his money. It was an invoked response to a rude refusal of funds. My dad is aging, does n't drive. He didn't want to walk miles to a different branch. So I agreed with representative that I will accompany my dad to make sure all forms are filled, & he has everything needed. As soon as I approached the manager in question, he had a very hateful look looking at my dad. Manager froze, looked at my dad with mouth open. I never spoke to this person, but he immediately started yelling at me that he feels that my dad is disgruntled because "" he slams ID onto counter ''. I didn't know there was proper way of putting down ID. He said that my dad raises his voice when he is told they won't help him. I responded that I'd be offended too. He has money, someone says "" I won't serve you. '' Of course my elderly father found that offensive. He is feeling like not a citizen of this Country by this person.

Of course if he refuses access to available funds, after lying they aren't available, my dad did raise his voice "" What's happening? Why are you doing this to me? "", but as cameras can show, that's a response. Invoked by pure XXXX. Invoked by antisemitism, & phobia of XXXX. This manager now refuses for my dad to get his money from this branch.

I, XXXX XXXX, had lost my job in XXXX. Notified the mortgage lender, HSBC, of the matter. I didn't land a job until approximately 3 months later, informed HSBC that I will began making payments in doubles until I was caught up, however, they had told me that there was a new policy stating that the whole past due amount ( totaling appx. 5000.00 dollars ) would need to be paid. Furthermore, no payment smaller than the past due amount would be accepted. 

At that time, it was winter going into spring, in XXXX New York. Therefore, I was behind in the heat and electricity, the car loan, and owed back payments in child support. There was no way for me to be able to pay the amount that was requested by HSBC. Hence, the house ended up in foreclosure. I could not afford a lawyer, at that time and still can not. 

After many phone calls, and time passing, the loan that had plagued my life, had been closed. The house was sold in an auction in XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, according to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( contact info : XXXX ). Although, on my credit report it shows that the account had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not understand how they had closed the account on this date when I was still making payments until I was unemployed. To make matters more confusing, this Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice via XXXX XXXX stating that I owe HSBC a past balance of {$120000.00} dollars, yet the loan was for {$55000.00}. Even more confusing is that it states that I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I WAS LIVING IN XXXX!!!!!!!! THE HOUSE WAS SOLD ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE THEN!!! WHICH, I HAD NO PRIOR INFORMATION ABOUT!!!!! 

I called HSBC ( contact info : HSBC BANK USA NA CREDIT INFORMATION DEPARTMENT XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ) looking for more info on the matter and they had directed me to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

06-08-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"We started a mortgage process with TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX, to purchase a condo in XXXX, NY for my daughters. We never shopped around because my daughter was very happy with TD services in the past 10 years. At the beginning, they offered a 30 year old mortgage with no points at 3.5 % fixed rate. Upon request, we provided all necessary documents TD asked for and through-out the process, we requested the closing to take place by XX/XX/XXXX since my daughters had to move out of their current apartment as others were scheduled to move in the next day. TD Bank consistently assured us that the closing WILL take place on time. To our surprise, a week before the closing date, TD started asking for the same documents that we had provided and waited to the last week for employment verification which they couldve done at the very beginning. The loan officer apologized for late handling and processing the case via email and phone calls. TD abject failure to deliver what was promised, caused the closing date to be postponed TWICE which caused us extreme hardship and added costs of living in a hotel for 4 nights and I had to postpone my flight twice. 
But, the most egregious part of the entire ordeal was when TD Bank inexplicably increased the interest rate to 4 % even-though we had a locked-in rate of 3.625 %, literally two days before the closing and after hundreds of phone calls, emails and texts begging them to honor what was agreed upon, they wouldnt budge and presented some bogus and questionable reasoning and justification. We strongly feel that TD kept us hostage and knowing that we had our belongings in a truck and living in a hotel, we had no other choice but to accept their unfair deal since we couldnt walk away. This was nothing but an extortion which I brought up to the attention of most TD staff including the Regional Sales Manger, but they couldnt care less. 
We even asked for some type of compensation for our additional expenses by a way of waving or reducing some of their fees and charges to no avail. 
Most attorneys and people involved at the closing which finally took place on XX/XX/XXXX, five days later than promised, all had negative comments about TD services due to their past experiences, particularly TD Mortgage Division.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,,,Consent provided,Web,06-08-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3331820

26-04-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"We called Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to get a payoff on our mortgage on XX/XX/, the account representative pulled the payoff in the amount of {$450.00}. The representative advised us that we could not transfer the money online ourselves and advised that she would handle this on the bank side. She got the account information but she entered the information for the account number wrong. OnXX/XX/XXXX my husband realized the amount never came out of our Wells Fargo checking account and called Wells Fargo back to find out why. The representative acknowledged their error and fixed the account draft and processed it correctly. The XXXX cleared our bank account on XX/XX/. 

On XX/XX/, we called Wells Fargo to check on our satisfaction of our lien that had not been processed with the XXXX County Register of Deeds. In NC there is a 30 day requirement to release a lien. The representative advised that they showed the lien had not been released and would send an urgent request to the lien release department to XXXX this paperwork. We were told that a representative would call me with this information. We received no call back. On XX/XX/, we called Wells Fargo back and were advised no additional work had been processed by the lien release department. A case was opened with the executive escalation department. OnXX/XX/XXXX, we called the executive department and received no updates to our request. Around XXXX the same day, a representative named XXXX from Wells called to say he was handling our request. He proceeded to state that my loan was not paid off and that I still owed {$450.00} since the first automatic draft did not complete. While on the phone, we pulled up our bank account and gave the cleared date of our draft. He proceeded to disagree with me even though he had no access to look at our Wells Fargo checking account. We are in receipt of a final payoff letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/ stating our account is paid in full. Our online banking confirms our mortgage account is paid in full. 

Here is our deed information {$160000.00}. Book 2494 page 1761 - 1782 datedXX/XX/XXXX. There is an extreme disconnect from the generation of a payoff letter and processing the release that needs to be investigated.

PRA disconnected, and I stayed on with XXXX and asked if they would be able to see ANY old collections. Rep. said she would be able to see any OLD collections ... I asked if she sees ANY old accounts for me on file ... she said NO. So now I have proof that PRA switched info in it's records to come after me for no reason.

10-12-2018,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,I added my son to my NFCU business account as an authorized user about 2 years ago or so. He was added with no problem. Today XX/XX/2018 my business assets are frozen because he owes them money and they blocked me out of my own business accounts. Apparently he owes them over {$5000.00} and they restricted my account because according ti them they can do that. My son went into a branch as was grossly discriminated against and treated like a criminal when I sent him to get a cashiers check. He has called in several times with me and they have been rude and We have been hung up on and when trying to speak to a supervisor I am advised that there is no one working that someone will return my call in 24 to 48 hours. According to what I know these accounts are from XX/XX/2010 and they are declining to forward information to validate the debt. On the recorded line the rep insisted he say that He acknowledge that he owes the money after repeated attempts by the rep in their recovery she hung up and became rude. By them restricting access to my buainess account it will cost me a total of about XXXX to XXXX in fees and other legal costs because of that.

Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX For over 6 months I have been disputing this account with the credit bureaus and each month they have not been able to report accurate information regarding this item. Many pieces of information that are being reported on this keep changing over and over and are not accurate! 

I also faxed in a request for the METHOD OF VERIFICATION by fax on XX/XX/XXXX and by law the credit bureaus is required to send within 15 days and this was NEVER RECEIVED. They are consistently reporting inaccurate information after repeated letters. I have attached all the documents. 

In Addition to failing to provide the method of verification after I requested by fax and proof of fax confirmation is enclosed : Credit Report dated XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) From the previous month 's credit report when pulled ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the balance changed from {$7400.00} to {$7300.00} which is inaccurate! 
2 ) The date of last payment is reporting XX/XX/XXXX also not accurate! The other two bureaus report different dates. 


On the previous month 's report dated XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) The balance changes from {$7300.00} to {$7400.00} which is not accurate! The other two bureaus show different balances!

2 ) The date of last payment switches from the month before from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX! Very inaccurate! 

On the previous months report dated XX/XX/XXXX 1 ) They are reporting a monthly payment of {$0.00} which is not accurate! 
2 ) Same issue with balance reporting {$7300.00} when the month before was {$7400.00}! Not accurate! 
3 ) The date of last payment is reporting XX/XX/XXXX when the month before it was XX/XX/XXXX On the previous month 's report dated XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) The balance again is {$7400.00} when it was {$7300.00} 2 ) The date of last payment changed again!

19-09-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"Dear Senator XXXX, AGO XXXX and Consumer Protection Bureau via Complaint ID # XXXX As your offices are aware, we have experienced deplorable customer service from JPMorgan Chase on our home mortgage and line of credit since XX/XX/XXXX. 

We are seniors and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MA XXXX, has been our primary residence since XX/XX/XXXX. We purchased our home on no doc through Washington Mutual. Chase took over the loan in XX/XX/XXXX and we refinanced from a 30 year fixed to a 15 year fixed mortgage Chase in XX/XX/XXXX. At the closing, Chase asked if we wanted a $ XXXX line of credit. We elected to accept only $ XXXX at the time, which was not accessed until XX/XX/XXXX. In  late XX/XX/XXXX, Chase invited us to increase our HELOC line from the $ XXXX to $ XXXX, but at an increase of 2 % on the entire balance. Going through the financial crisis causing negative Government effect on my FCC Broadcast ownership, XXXX and XXXX children in college, we accepted going forward with the new terms. Chase then delayed for months stating our home value decreased and despite adequate funds in the bank and questioned amount of money I was taking from my owned radio station XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase finally dictated to us that our only option was modification but we had to skip two payments to be considered. 

Chase then reported us to the credit bureaus and the modification approval for the stated 60 months finally came in XX/XX/XXXX, but extended only 42 months with a balloon payment for the full mortgage due XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, Chase miscoded a bank routing number on a payment and then took months to determine it was their error. Then, Chase interrupted our applications for new financing by starting foreclosure notices. Chase further delayed and hindered our efforts to change lenders. 

Finally, after finally being put in touch with the Chase Executive Office in XX/XX/XXXX,  Chase agreed, in XX/XX/XXXX to a second modification at our out of pocket cost of {$36000.00}. Chase refused to spread that amount over the ensuing 200 payments in the second modification. 

In both XX/XX/XXXX and upon our XX/XX/XXXX approval of the second modification, Chase promised to A ) adjust late fees, interest charges and legal fees, B ) make sure the credit bureaus knew we were up to date on the mortgage & HELOC, C ) correct Chases superficial appraisal of our home which is at least $ XXXX too low - $ XXXX compared to a complete modification performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at $ XXXX - and D ) make arrangements to finally add to our line of credit. E ) The rate of interest on the new modification is quite high, 4.87 %. 

We continue to get lip service, run around, rude correspondence and phone conversation from Chase. The letters they have sent to me and your offices have no credibility as they do not address Chase mistakes and the horrible, inappropriate manner of customer service from Chase. The Chase letters repeat their old decisions that were incorrect in the first place. 

We are seniors, never bankrupt, with a Chase debt of less than $ XXXX on our primary/only residence HUD and the CPB valued several months ago at over {$1.00} million. Chase is disregarding the importance of our Senior Financial Health and discriminating against seniors ability to have simple access to less than 49 % of their home equity for medical, improvement, college and living expenses. Further, Chase has been rude and tremendously challenged in delaying proceedings. Chase representatives stall, take months to say its not this department and have told us to find another lender, get a reverse mortgage or move! 

With a tremendous amount of phone, email, letter, fax correspondence shared with your offices and Chase, I must ask that you now step in and hold Chase accountable for this harmful, stressful, prolonged and costly behavior negatively affecting us, and other senior customers. We ask for all fee and interest adjustments and for a favorable arrangement to have access to up to 49 % of our home FMV, without further delay. 

Please respond and thank you for protecting senior citizens who need and deserve your intervention.

There was an incident that happened with my company and the merchant that was involved to receive my payments so they could ship the products to my customers but they canceled the transaction prior when the purchased occurred. 

However, I have contacted the merchant company which was XXXX to asked what happened after a couple of days without my knowledge of knowing what had happened. I recall one of the customer service said the transaction was canceled within 24 hours so which clearly means the products didn't get fulfilled for my customers.

From this point I'm confident that they will release/refund my money which they did, they simply refunded within 72 hours. So which means banks release the money within 3-5 business days to my account.

I have waited for more than 10 days, I was like maybe something went wrong with the merchant so I contacted them and they said usually this takes 3-20 business days, so I'm satisfied and moved on with my month, 30 days passed and still, nothing is happening. I definitely contacted the bank and told them that I still didn't receive the money. 

I filed a claim dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. The bank reached out to the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX. Literary the bank took that much time to reach out, their word was "" 90 days '' to get this solved. 90 days passed around XX/XX/XXXX, and they said : "" we have to wait until 90 days for the merchant to get back to us. '' What totally made me reach out to you guys was, this has been almost more than 100 days since when they said "" 90 days '' for the consumer, not the merchant. 

I would like my funds back. All I wanted was them to push that button and release my money to my account since the merchant already refunded me. I lost my trust with Bank Of America, I would like you guys to come in and help me with this case because they clearly give zero XXXX for the customers.

19-02-2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"We entered into a loan modification application process with Wells Fargo on our FHA Rehab mortgage in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. We provided all requested documentation and were approved, and given a lower monthly payment on a 90 day trial period. No information was given as to how they arrived at this payment, or what would happen for them to achieve this payment amount, until AFTER we paid 3 months of trial payments. 

We made the first two trial period payments and Wells Fargo sent us a letter that we'd been removed from the program. I called them and found out they had sent us a letter that we had to sign and send back agreeing to the trial period. They didn't tell us it would be coming or required and it was apparently sent via regular mail, not certified or overnighted, and we never received it. That's 2 payments made. 

So they started us over again, new trial period, and we made 3 payments in XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. That's 5 trial period payments we made at that point. We received an email that we'd been approved for the HAMP modification and would be receiving paperwork that we would need to have notarized and sent back. No details as to what it was or any figures. Just an approval email. 

We received an overnight packet from XXXX  with the modification paperwork and figures. I called in to Wells Fargo after looking over the numbers, and I wanted a detailed itemization of the figures that they came up with to modify the loan. My foreclosure "" specialist '' could not answer these simple questions - even though all the numbers are there in their computer system. She got belligerent with me on the phone about how I "" better make the payment '', etc ... I sent several emails and left voicemails with ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE back. NO email responses from her, NO letters in the mail, NO return phone calls. 

I called and made another payment over the phone with someone else on XX/XX/XXXX ( after no explanations, no responses and no calls returned ), and then on XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a letter in the mail that they "" are no longer moving forward with the HAMP program '' for our account. 

A few days later, I receive a letter from their foreclosure attorney, and last Thursday, the sheriff posted the court documents on my front door that state our foreclosure hearing is set with the county on  XX/XX/XXXX. 

We qualified for, and were approved for, a HAMP loan modification. We did not however, know what was involved prior to the trial period payments - only what the payment itself would be. 

I am not happy with the modification numbers and did not sign the documents that were sent to me, instead I wanted to work with my mortgage company to see if there was an alternative, but they REFUSE TO RESPOND and now have us set for foreclosure. I feel my rights as a consumer have been violated by the mortgage company refusing to answer questions or explain their figures, which I believe are double-dipping, and possibly fraudulent or illegal.

I have all emails I sent to the foreclosure "" specialist '' and records of calls and voicemails left that were never returned. Every letter the specialist ever sent clearly stated "" please call me if you have any questions ''. I had questions - she refused to answer them, and then refused to respond altogether. She removed us from the program instead. Even though we qualified for assistance. I just want to verify the numbers before signing - because they show that we will end up owing more than we started with after making three years ' worth of payments. And they were increasing our interest rate, not lowering it. They took a chunk of the principal balance and "" amount in deliquency '' ( the number they refused to explain how they arrived at it ) and are setting it out as a perpetual silent second mortgage that will never be paid down or paid off until we sell or refinance the property. At which time, WF will receive all of that money - double dipping when they get it. We were not given any other option as far as lower interest rate, extended term of the mortgage, nothing.

And now, thanks to WF XXXX us around, we're even further behind in the payments. This should have been handled in a timely manner and it was NOT. It's been over 90 days since I made the 3rd payment of the trial period, and I made an additional payment last month in XXXX after not hearing anything from them. Now that they've set a court hearing, they won't accept another payment from me, and that will cause more months to go behind. 

On top of that, this company receives millions of dollars in HAMP funds each year to help people struggling with their payments - there is no evidence in these numbers that ANY HAMP funds were being used to help us. I'm not asking for free money, but if the government intends those funds to be used to help people, and WF isn't using them to do just that, then WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THOSE MILLIONS ( WILL BE BILLIONS BY XXXX WHEN IT ENDS ) OF DOLLARS IN HAMP FUNDS? Are they just eating that money? My trial payment letter clearly states we were in a HAMP loan modification. But every dollar is showing it's coming from us in the end, not HAMP funds at all. And now, the HAMP program is no longer accepting applications? 

I don't know where to turn at this point. But I believe this is an illegal foreclosure. We did everything they asked us to do, and we had every right to question the numbers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,271XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,19-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3155728

( 2 ) A fraudulent practice or conduct is characterized by deceit or trickery, an intentional perversion of the truth to induce another to part with something of value or to surrender a legal right, or an act of deceiving or misrepresenting. Fraud also includes any other  definition of fraud under applicable law. Example A : A mortgage originator employed by a mortgage broker has promised a certain low-rate mortgage loan to a consumer. However, the consumer does not have the minimum debt-to-income ratio set by the lender preferred by the mortgage originators employer to qualify for the lowest-rate mortgage loan offered. Therefore, the mortgage originator changes the XXXX statement of the consumer to reflect a higher income for the consumer without the consumers knowledge, and then submits the documentation to the lender. Example B : An employee of a mortgage lender contacts a real estate appraiser with a request to perform an appraisal and informs the appraiser that the sale price of the property is {$150000.00}. The employee knows that the property will not appraise for that amount, but promises the appraiser future business if the appraiser can make the deal work. The mortgage loan is closed by the mortgage lender based upon the appraisal report showing the value of the property as {$150000.00}. I was tricked into this mortgage during desperate times.

I've made them aware of the government shutdown effect and have not worked for the past 3 almost 4 weeks. I paid the amount owed for XX/XX/XXXX but somehow hasn't gone through because I haven't received any payments since XX/XX/XXXX. I asked if anything can be forgive being the government shutdown. They mentioned they do not participate in the shutdown and needed to make a payment immediately. I asked if 30 days could be waived because this will effect my credit tremendously, they told the arent able to waive anything and a supervisor told me to contact the three credit bureaus. I contacted all three and they told me it's the creditor obligation to update not the credit bureau. I just want to have some sort of leverage as I've and 800k workers have been effected for this silly shutdown. I would like if they can allow at least an 30 day waiver for XX/XX/XXXX.

Anytime I make an additional payment they somehow administratively XXXX up the payment to be disbursed to the wrong loan. 

The loan is a Consolidated Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loan. They have a system set up on their website to allocate funds to a specific loan ( i.e. highest current balance, highest current interest ratel, or prorate across selected loans etc. ). I want to pay my loans off as fast as possible, so I have chosen to submit additional payments to the the Consolidated Subsidized loan, which has the least amount of principal left. 

Anytime I make an additional payment, I have to call them and correct their mistake because they will always split the additional payment between the Subsidized and Unsubsidized Consolidated loan. After calling them and having the additional payment made to the Subsized Loan, they automatically prorate the next payment, so my automatic payment isn't being distributed the way I want as well. I spoke to them on the phone and requested they not do that, but do it every time. 

It seems their website has a system in place to help the user, but their system isn't functioning properly when you choose what you want. 

Also, it seems silly that I need to take time out of my day consistently to make sure they are applying my additional payments to a loan I have specified to them numerous times. 

My additional payments are {$100.00}, and my automatic payment is {$290.00} and it comes out every month on the XXXX.

I quoted the loan with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2018 and he promised it can be closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I thought it is perfect timing because my lease ending date is XX/XX/2018. However, it is a mistake to decide to work with XXXX and XXXX. Their irresponsible promise and carelessness service made me into very stressful situation and caused me a loss of {$960.00}. 

Starting XX/XX/XXXX I begin to submit materials requested. The loan processor I worked with is XXXX XXXX, NMLS # XXXX. For any materials he requested, I submitted to him promptly. He promised the close date is XX/XX/2018 until XX/XX/2018, he told me because the confirmation of my XXXX status, he could only submit he project review on XX/XX/2018 and my loan would be delayed to be closed on XX/XX/2018. 

At that time, I already give notice to the landlord which means I must move into the property on XX/XX/2018. 

However, I trusted him I can still move into the property though it is inconvenient to me. In addition, my parents is visiting me from XXXX and we planned to be on vacations during holidays. 

After that, he kept on telling me everything is on track and we would be close on time until XX/XX/XXXX, he disappeared. He responded the next day and told me the bank wouldnt close the loan and the bank would not be responsible for any expense of hotel. He kept on lying to me he could cancel the loan or the loan would be close on this date and that date. 

Because his dereliction of duty, I have to pay {$120.00} a day to live in hotel for a total of {$960.00}. 

The delay ruined my entire holiday plan. I canceled the trips to south California because the loan wouldnt be closed. I would not go with PNC if they have told me the timeline in the first place. I think the whole practice is against UDAAP. 

Besides, XXXX promised to provide the project review copy but he did not. He again lied to me.",,PNC Bank N.A.,CA,945XX,,Consent provided,Web,02-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3113905

So I logged in and in order to read all of the pertinent information, I had to opt in two or three different companies to be able to contact me at any time. If I did not want to do this on the computer that way, at the bottom was a number to call and do it over the phone. I was not clear about a 2.9 % charge, so I called to make sure I had a better understanding. I called the first time and spoke with customer service to explain the charge. I was told 0 % for 12 Months and a 2.9 % charge for any additional purchases made on the account. I said ok thank you. I called the second time and asked the same question and was told 0 % for 12 Months and a 2.9 % charge for any additional purchases made on the card. I did the balance transfer on XX/XX/2019 and it posted on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$3700.00}. It was a 4 % Balance Transfer Fee of 4 % which in total is {$150.00}. On XX/XX/2019 I made a small payment of {$33.00} and my balance was {$3800.00}. On XX/XX/2019 around XXXX I noticed my balance changed to {$3900.00}. I checked online and it stated, "" Interest Charge on Purchases {$3.00}. '' I didn't make any purchases, So I immediately called WellsFargo to see what happened and was told because I did the balance transfer in the middle of the month. I stated, "" What difference does it make if the promotion was over XX/XX/2019. '' He kept putting me on hold and could not give me an answer. he put in a complaint and gave me a complaint number and stated that a Case Manager of some sort would call me back in a day. A day went by no call so I called them. Let 's just say I called six different times, I have two complaints filed with numbers. The people I was transferred to where very rude and not knowledgeable about anything that I was asking. According to WellsFargo all the calls are recorded. So the last person I spoke with by the name of XXXX stated that the Case Managers were out. I said well when will I receive a phone call back and he stated, I don't know their schedules and being very rude. He also stated the case manager was out sick and my case was assigned that day. So on my part the calls started on XX/XX/2019. After going back and forth and nobody has called me back regarding my issue six different times and it is XX/XX/2019. WellsFargo in my opinion is practicing unethical business practices and I will not forget what happened last year with them stealing customers information and making accounts without their knowledge to get bonuses. They are misleading in their promotions with unethical, deceptive practices. I deserve answers!!!! All the calls are recorded, so Pull the calls WellsFargo and hear the proof of your unprofessional staff, customer service, me the customer asking to explain the 2.9 % charge and both customer service representatives stating 0 $ for 12 months and 2.9 % for any additional purchases. Also, I asked every call how the 2.9 % would be charged ; daily, monthly, annually and no answers. No managers are ever around, case managers are always out and nobody has called me back to rectify this situation.

Right after that my husband XXXX and we went overseas to XXXX so i was unable to call and check bt i sent multiple emails and no response. To find out the dealer took the car back and it was sold at auction. When we got back to the stated the dealer no longer works there and i called XXXX XXXX and no one was able to assist me. The car was sold at action and stated as a write off when i called cx service bt they want me to do a settlement. I explained that the car had a defect issue and it took it back to the dealer bt we soon went overseas. I have asked for contracts and proof of sale or anything from the dealership to clear my name bt was unable to provide. I disputed it and they took it off but reopened it like 2 months later and dropped my score tremendously. I have no car to show for it and cant get another one and its hurting me and taking a toll on my Health and family.

Plus they closed and removed it then reopened my account on my score years after my car was gone.

I never received the hospital bill, and did not know what the insurance didn't pay until my credit was affected. Once I realized I had a balance at the hospital I paid it off in full to the hospital. The debt collection company XXXX was the debt collection agency in which was responsible for sending a notice of payment to the credit bureaus, in which I had been promised would be a paid and deletion letter. Where I am at fault is I never wrote down the name of the woman that gave me this promise.The account was updated to being paid on my credit report, however it was not deleted of my report as promised. I have been in contact with the company XXXX about this issue and I am not receiving a solution. Now the company is telling me "" deleting accounts is against their company policy '' which conflict with the original promise of deletion. I spoke with a representative today that stated "" We only delete accounts when it is our fault, and it is not our fault you didn't pay your bill.

The Georgia Industrial Loan Act of 1955 essentially made payday lending illegal by requiring state licensing and registration and by imposing strict usury limits on small loans.

This practice is more of a collusion between Credit Reporting companies and Lenders. It really is as though you take one step forward and end up two steps backwards. It literally is putting the cart before the horse.

15-01-2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"I have had these two credit cards for many years, but between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX,  besides my own medical and dental bills, I was taking care of my elderly mom and got my two Mastercard credit cards with Capital One maxed out. Approximately a year ago I requested that Capital One please freeze my accounts, stop all interest, and let me continue to pay on the principal balance. They would not agree to that. I also offered a {$12000.00} payoff v. the balance of approximately {$16000.00}, and they would not agree to that either. 

I was on a plan for lesser payments, but ultimately they kept requiring me to catch payments up, including late fees assessed for not making full payments, and of course interest. The amount of interest being charged monthly is more than the payments I was making. I tried to settle with them, but nothing has worked. I can not afford an attorney for bankruptcy at this time, and their payment requirements are now beyond reach. 

I was going to utilize another credit card for a no interest period, but my credit has been destroyed and my other card now has only {$1000.00} available, not the {$12000.00} I had available when this started with my trying to settle with them over the last year or more. 

I have now paid so much interest that I have more than likely paid at least half of what would have been the original balance. I would like to see if you can help in any way. I think Capital One should have let me pay on the principal balance and stopped any interest from accruing. 

According to our Constitution, interest is not legal, and maybe some day that can be enforced again, but I would ask at minimum that they reduce the balance due by removing all interest they have charged me, at least for the last year or so that I have been trying to work with them, and also late payment fees while I was making the lesser payments they agreed to.. 

They told me it would save my credit report if I made the lesser payments under their plan but obviously that has not been the case. 

I finally stopped making payments because, as I said, the interest continued to be more than any payment I would make. Since discovering MasterCard is also providing funds for the invasion of illegal immigrants into our country by providing them with prepaid debit cards, it is my feeling that they should release all debt and clear my credit report.

13-02-2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem related to refinancing,"I XXXX XXXX purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I financed it through XXXX XXXX I made all payments on time. On XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced this loan with Bank of America. Made all Payments on time.In early XX/XX/XXXX, My car was stolen and then recovered. It was a total loss, I continued making payments though out this process. The payoff check from the insurance was processed XXXX XXXX. Which left a balance of XXXX on the acc. 
After this I heard nothing from BOA and could access the current Balance on my Online mobile banking. So XXXX 's Payment went though, XXXX 's payment went though, and XXXX 's payment went through. My Payment Date for this loan is XXXX of each month. So then on XXXX XXXX I get a notification that a Charge off was placed on my Credit files with all Three Bureaus from BOA. Stating that {$210.00} was charged off??? and isn't due till XXXX XXXX which would be my last payment. This is crazy I Made all Payments. 
I Spoke with XXXX XXXX and she was not helpful, and for a week I got no repose. Then they fabricated a whole Story about how i was suppose to Pay off that Balance of {$850.00} with in 60days, then they said i had no GAP which I do.. when I said had "" no notice '' of this arbitrary 60 policy, she stated they wouldn't remove it. Even though they were auto-debting the acc every month. Bank Of america is blatantly trying to save face and not fixing this false Charge off. I am inclosing a full payment history which shows on time payments. I had to get a print out from the a bank Employee because they where told not to give to it to me, But Lucky there own employee saw how wrong they where treating me and printed it off for me anyway.The cover up of this false Charge OFF is sicking!! ACC of this loan as it was deleted off my online Banking for this reason. But i have the evidence. My Previous Credit Score Was XXXX This Damaged my Score over 75 points. All of this for no reason!! And they refuse to fix it. 
And also the XXXX XXXX Lady had the audacity to try and collect the {$210.00} that never should of been charged off in the first and still not fix the charge off on my credit!!!! I will Pursue legal Action If this isn't fixed. And to think all these idiots had to do was wait till the auto-debt on the XXXX of XXXX the payment would be done!!! even on the credit report the BOA states Charge Off Never Late How smart is that? Again This XXXX lady couldn't answer why the charge off was placed on my acc even though they still where getting payment.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",MO,,,Consent provided,Web,13-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3150699

01-03-2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Loan balance remaining after the vehicle is repossessed and sold,"I financed a XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX through XXXXr XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX with {$3600.00} down and a rate of 26 %. A salesman named XXXX XXXX from XXXX informed me that nothing was wrong with the vehicle when I test drove it. He was not honest with me as months later I later discovered that the vehicle instrument cluster was defective. 
The vehicle was transferred down to Miami and a salesman named XXXX XXXX collected my down payment and again assured me that the vehicle had no problems or issues. The XXXX report he provided me did not show the instrument cluster repair. I decided to purchase the car. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I was a victim of financial fraud of {$1000.00} by a lady named XXXX XXXX from PA XXXX case XXXX, XXXX PA XXXX and couldn't afford to make payment then. I informed Santander of this. I made XXXX more payment in late XXXX and in XXXX, Santander gave me a XXXX month extension due to financial hardship and a loss of a family member. In XXXX, I also cancelled the XXXX warranty of {$2800.00} and was refunded this amount by XXXX back to Santander. Since then, I have not made any payments because I discovered that the vehicle instrument cluster was replaced 5 years ago. I complained about this to both XXXX and Santander and neither business tried to resolve the issue. I was also struggling to get permanent employment and I was concerned about the high interest rate of 26 %. I asked for Santander to lower the rate and my request was denied. Without an explanation of the 26 % rate, Santander has forced me to accept that the rate is reasonable for my credit and income level. 
In addition : - Santander never justified the reason for my 26 % rate, the highest in the country - Santander never applied ANY portion of any of my payments ( {$4500.00} total ) towards interest or principal. 
- Santander varied the final payout balance numerous times from {$17000.00} to {$19000.00} to {$16000.00} to {$18000.00} in only a 7 month period. 
- Santander never showed on my account page how much interest is being accrued daily, weekly, or monthly and how much has been paid. 
- Neither Santander nor XXXX offered to replace my car with its defective instrument cluster for a different vehicle. 
- Numerous complaints filed against XXXX by me regarding the defective instrument cluster were ignored by the BBB. 
- I posted a complaint on XXXX against XXXX regarding the replaced instrument cluster and the complaint was removed by XXXX in XXXX. 

Santander promised me that they'll give me until Friday, XX/XX/XXXX to make a payment and they will not repo the vehicle. I told them that I will make payment that day because that's when I'll receive my first paycheck from my new job. Santander agreed and gave me the extension. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, my vehicle was picked up from a parking lot while I was siting inside a XXXX. Santander completely disregarded our prior agreement and repossessed the vehicle, leaving me stranded in XXXX, Fl, more than XXXX miles from my home without a way for me to get back to work. After calling the police on XX/XX/XXXX who notified me that the vehicle was indeed a repo, I was stuck at the XXXX after hours sitting at a table outside with my wallet and other personal property inside the car. I did not know anyone in the area and I had to walk to a nearby XXXX to spend the night there. I called Santander again on Monday, XXXX XXXX requesting to return the vehicle to me due to the fact they violated our agreement and the refused, instead demanding I cough up {$2700.00}.",,Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.,FL,331XX,,Consent provided,Web,01-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3166723
