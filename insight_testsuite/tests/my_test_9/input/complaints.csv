Upon examination of the report, I noticed that there were some inaccurate items that should not be there. 

After sending certified, return receipt letters on XX/XX/18 ( which were received on XX/XX/18 ), reporting that there were inaccuracies on my credit report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, account # : XXXX, claiming that I owe {$8100.00}, I requested that I would like some type of verification bearing my signature. I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. 

Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community. Since no verification of any kind has ever been sent to me or provided, I am seeking that this particular inaccurate claim is removed immediately. 

Not only has no information bearing my signature ever been provided when requested, but is also Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act - including but not limited to Section 611, such as : -FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) -FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) Depending upon how this matter is handled, I will also be detailing any potential issues via an online public press release, including any documentation of potential small claims action.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",CA,945XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,21-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3158080

XXXX  was very easy to work with always had the most accurate information. Information regarding the number of qualifying payments was available and up to date on their website. In XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were taken over and transferred by XXXX XXXX without my request, approval or knowledge. I found out this occurred the next time I contacted XXXX. Since I am nearing retirement age, I am always checking to see what the status is of my "" qualifying months ''. Every year I submit a new Employment Verification form as advised by the Department of Education. I contacted XXXX XXXX to request this information and they have NEVER been able to tell me what the number of qualifying months is. The employees who are supposed to provide customer service are anything but. They have an attitude and skirt around every question or request for information I present to them. The ONLY place you can find the qualifying number of payments is on the statement. However, the number of qualifying months KEEPS CHANGING going up and down, mostly going down and my student loan balance keeps going up. They aslo tell me they can not verify any of the payments made to XXXX  yet my account was transferred to XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted them because the XX/XX/XXXX Statement shows only 12 qualifying payments, however, the XX/XX/XXXX statement shows 32 qualifying payments. I thought perhaps there was an error in adding the newly approved payments from the recently submitted Employment Certification Form to the already identified 32 qualifying payments. I was told that since I requested an audit on my account ALL the payments had to be re-verified. This process has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX and they could not tell me how long it would take. I asked to speak to a manager and was basically told that's they way they do things, would not provide me any policy stating the process, did not offer to expedite the process and said this could cause my qualifying payments to do down. Now how hard is it to qualify the payments each year and then add the new qualifying payments each year they receive an Employment Certification form. It is very disenchanting when the qualifying payments becomes a moving target. I am unable to plan for my retirement not knowing how many more years I have to work so my loan will be forgiven. In the meantime, my balance keeps going up and if my qualifying payments are one short, I will owe the entire amount irregardless of what I have been paying since XX/XX/XXXX.",,AES/PHEAA,FL,335XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,11-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3121964

My granddaughter XXXX XXXX is making payments on this student loan she obtained.

She only attended XXXX University for one year and had to come back as her mother had a XXXX XXXX. Came back home to get a job to help her mother. My daughter earns less than XXXX @ {$10.00} per hour and is eligible for food stamps. XXXX has to choose no insurance coverage at work because she can't afford it. 
As I stated she wants to comply with the payments @ {$50.00} per month and can barely afford that. 
What I don't understand is how the balance is {$16000.00} when I believe she applied for an additional {$5000.00} "" mother loan ''. 
Again she wants to pay as she is already paying her other student loan she just can't afford {$120.00} per month.

My account was closed for no reason. 

I went to check my account online only to find out that it had been closed. I tried to contact the company on this day only to find out that my account online had been suspended. Also I tried phone contact and the automated system is telling me the same thing and would not process my call for me to speak with a customer service rep. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I finally was able to get through and spoke with XXXX ( Supervisor in the Acct. Protection Services ). XXXX stated that the account had been suspended for fraudulent activity and that it was being looked into. I would be notified via email. I never received any type correspondance from Amex/Bluebird in regards to my acct. Every customer rep that I spoke with this day is telling me the same thing. 

So on XX/XX/XXXX, I called again and explained my situation to a customer service rep. Who responded with the same info as the call on XX/XX/XXXX. Now I ask to speak with another Supervisor. I speak with XXXX ( Acct. Protection Servicces ). XXXX says my account is still being investigated. It takes 7-10 business days. She went further on to say that {$28.00} was being sent back to sender ( XXXX XXXX ) & the balance of $ XXXX-a direct deposit transaction will be refunded via a check. Again 7-10 business days. Still no correspondance from AMex as to why the account was closed and when/where my money is, What transactions were fraud. nothing. 

i given plenty of time for some type of letter, something to be sent to me. I had a balance of {$66.00} left on the acct. It wasn't returned to sender and I have not received my funds back. These funds had been sitting on the account why wasn't it flagged upon deposit. Which by the way was from a legit bank account. 

Today XX/XX/19 I call the company again demanding an answer as to where my money is. I again speak with a customer service rep. who by the way had me on hold for like 15 min. only for her to tell me the same as previous, and that I would need to write the company. I then speak with XXXX ( supervisor ). She also had me on hold for like 15min. Today this whole call started @ XXXX and went on 42 minutes. Being put on hold multiple times only for XXXX to come back and tell me that I need to write the company @ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX. Also that I will not be getting my money refunded to me for fraud. 

WHY AND WHERE IS MY MONEY. IM TIRED OF THE RUN AROUND. All I want is my money back. You can't just take my balance on my card, close the account and not say nothing to the customer. It's bad enough if you send me a check I have to pay to cash the check for my own money. 

To resolve this issue all I want is my money back. After repeated attempts to get answers and my money back your company is not doing anything to assist me and I'm 1 livid person right now.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,VA,,,Consent provided,Web,12-08-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3335092

Unfortunately, that payment went to the wrong person. The number had one of the digits wrong and was received by the wrong person. I made the transaction before XXXX XXXX and didn't find out until later that evening. The person that was supposed to get the money called me asking if I sent the money. That's when I realized the money was linked to the wrong person on accident. At that moment I was fine and called customer service right away. When I called, the lady I spoke to said that it was too late to reverse the claim. They transferred me to the fraud department to start a claim. The person I spoke to at the fraud department basically told me that the only way for me to get it was by having that person return my money back. To me, that sounded absurd so I asked how come they wouldn't do that instead of asking me to do it myself. The lady basically said they will try within 45 calendar days. At that point I freaked out so I decided to call the lady after I was done speaking to the fraud department. After numerous attempts and dialing from different numbers, the lady finally answered. When I spoke to her she kept saying that I was trying to scam her. She also stated that such money was already gone from her account and she also wanted to speak to her family to she how she should proceed with this. I was on the phone with her for over 30 minutes, explaining to her and asking her to please send it back to me. Once I mentioned law enforcement, she hung up and never answered her phone again. I tried to file a police report after that call and they basically said they couldn't do it because she wasn't doing anything illegal. I explained that she knows that money isn't hers and she's still not giving it back so that's pretty much stealing knowingly. They denied me the police report and at this point I'm blown away. I kept calling customer service to check on the status of my claim and they kept on telling me to wait, that I would receive a letter in the mail. Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, my account was credited and refunded. I was happy but that happiness didn't last long enough. The following day the money was taken away again and was told that my money was gone and that they weren't able to get the money back from that person 's bank account and I had to pay for it.

Equifax has violated FCRA rules and consistently failed to delete several inaccurate, unverifiable, adverse and erroneous accounts that they posted on my credit report. These inaccurate accounts are as follows : XXXX ( account # XXXX  ) in the amount of {$570.00} and XXXX ( account # XXXX  ) in the amount of {$570.00} and XXXX ( account # XXXX  ) in the amount of {$190.00}. 

Under the laws of the FDCPA, I have contacted the collection agency myself and have been unable to get them to verify that this is indeed my debt. I also will enclose the lettered copies of my communication to XXXX. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Equifax is required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts they post on a consumer credit report. Ill enclose the copies of several letters ( with certified mailed receipts ) that I sent to Equifax in request to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) for the adverse the accounts they continue to post on my credit report. I have suffered extensive grief and emotional distress due to Equifaxs failure to accurately verify these accounts, resulting in my inability to obtain credit. I have also advised Equifax that according to Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA they are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. 

Equifax was also furnished proof that the XXXX ( account # xxxxxxxx ) in the amount of {$190.00} was in fact disputed and DELETED from my credit report by XXXX  and XXXX  SINCE XX/XX/2018 ; ( I will re submit the proof of deletions via attachment ). However, Equifax continues to carelessly and negligently continue to post that inaccurate account ( {$190.00} ) to my credit report!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

In the absence of such documentation ( an original Consumer Contract ) bearing my signature, I formally request Equifax immediately delete all the aforementioned derogatory accounts from my credit report associated under my Social Security number. I will litigate if this request is not honored. 

Note : This CFPB complaint is solely directed to Equifax Credit Bureau.

By clicking a large number of pale, hard-to-spot icons, I was able to open detail sections of the report. But the details were displayed using colored icons that disappeared when I attempted to print them. Only blank white space appeared. 

Nowhere on the page could I find a link for a printable or downloadable version of the report. I tried several ways of saving the web page itself, but none of them preserved the report data. 

While I was attempting to find a way to successfully save or print the data, my browser reported, "" For security reasons, your session has expired. '' The report vanished from my screen. 

In summary, Experian provided me a report that could not be printed or saved, that I could only view for a short time before it was erased from my browser. Such behavior might satisfy the letter of the FCRA, but can hardly satisfy its spirit. 

I've not had such problems in the past with XXXX or XXXX reports.

SPS statements they mailed to me indicates that I owe XXXX XXXX dollars ( XXXX ) for property taxes, which is not true but they refused to tell me how they derived at that number. There are also charges that show XXXX charges for inspections with no details as to why, especially since I was not in foreclosure. I sent SPS a payment history to show that the billing was incorrect however they refused to stop the Auction of my home scheduled for XX/XX/2019. I filed a Notice of Error on XX/XX/2019 they have ignored the notice, even though they have opened an inquiry for research. They indicated they did not have to stop it because of the RESPA regulations did not apply to Dual Tracking for this incident. The notice of error stated numerous accounting errors by SPS, over charges and other erroneous charges from companies that I do not know that are on the SPS statement of charges sent out by the previous servicer and SPS. 

I also was charged for numerous inspections charges for my home when my home was not in foreclosure. I was charged BPO charges and legal fees when my account was in a current status. I am not sure of what the charges are that are on my account and why, but I asked that SPS give  an accounting to why they continued to charge those incorrect amounts to my mortgage account when I have indicated they were incorrect many times. They are currently ignoring my request. I requested that SPS review my account and make corrections to my interest and my principle, they have refused to this date to do that. 
SPS on XX/XX/XXXX received a QWR they have refused to respond to my request, they indicated they will respond to it after my home is auctioned off which does not make a lot of sense to me. SPS has given erroneous information about the status of my account, I was told by several managers especially one that opened the research to verify the accounting errors on my account that the auction of my home would be postponed until that happened. Of course that was lies. I have requested several call backs from supervisor in the department of the Ombudsman and litigations no one will return the call. I requested that other executives in SPS ( any department ) return the call and address my inquiries and there has been no response, no call back and no evidence that they are willing to allow a workout plan. This has been blatant bullying and harassment from SPS with refusal to discuss with me the status of my account. 

The interest on my account is incorrect because of the erroneous charges therefore the principle is incorrect I have as for a pay-off and settlement which they withdrew which was a breach of the prior agreement in place. I have charges on my account for forced place insurance that need to be corrected and adjusted on my account.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",KY,402XX,,Consent provided,Web,18-06-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3278843

25-07-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Back in XXXX of XXXX I called Ocwen who is my mortgage lender because I was behind on my payments. The representative I spoke to suggested that I do a loan modification. I told him I would like to try that so he was sending me the paperwork. I asked him that if in the meantime I should bring my mortgage current because I could borrow the money from someone I knew. He said yes go ahead and do that. When I got the paperwork I gathered all the documents filled out the paperwork and sent it in. It came back denied, when I asked them if they could tell me why I was denied they told me that it was because I was not behind on my payments! I was angry because that person I knew that if I became current I would not qualify. Their response was that they always encourage people to make their payments! So I continue to struggle making my payments. And in XXXX of XXXX I was behind again. I had a law firm that was contacting me that told me they could help me get my payments 2 less than {$700.00} a month. I had my income tax return so I could have brought my mortgage current but the law firm told me not to because they would have to start their process I'm getting a new loan modification for me all over. That ended up being a disaster because they claim they did not know about a deferred amount on my mortgage and I ended up with a loan modification the changed my monthly payment from {$1000.00} a month to {$1500.00} a month. That was finalized and I started making those payments around XXXX of XXXX. I fell behind again and when I try to make a partial payment at the beginning of XXXX of XXXX the website told me that I needed to make a payment of {$5000.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. I proceeded to gather the money and a week before that date I called to find out if I could just make the payment over the phone. The representative I spoke to said I could do that. I asked him if it would withdraw that very same day because I had money going in that day and I wanted to make sure that the money was in there before the withdrawal came out. He told me that I could make the payment the following week and if that would be okay. So he said he would make a notation in my file that I was going to make the payment on XX/XX/XXXX of {$5000.00} over the phone. When XX/XX/XXXX came and I called to make the payment they said I could not make the payment. They told me I had to call a law firm and talk to someone named XXXX. When I called the number they gave me there was no one named XXXX working there but the woman told me that I was speaking to that she could help me. She said that she could get me a new reinstatement quote an email it to me within 3 days. When I received that quote it was for {$7400.00} because there were lawyer fees attached as well and the date I had to come up with that by was XX/XX/XXXX. I do not understand how a company can just tell people whatever they want and not honor the agreements they make. There is something very wrong with all of this and I believe that I have been treated very unfairly.",,Ocwen Financial Corporation,MN,,,Consent provided,Web,29-07-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3318639

The departments they were from was Account Managers and Account Opening Specialists continuing to bounce myself back and forth. I am trying to figure out if my husband and i are permanently blacklisted from ever having another Discover card again. 

My husband and I both had Discover cards in XXXX which were closed back in XX/XX/XXXX if i recall correctly, by Discover. Per a rep i was advised our accounts are marked as "" Revoked/Closed. '' My husband has a XXXX balance with 100 % payments with Discover. Only remark is "" Account closed by XXXX XXXX. '' I am in a similar boat only difference is i am still paying my balance off but 100 % payments made with every lender including Discover.

Any time one of us tries to apply with Discover or attempts a Pre-Qualification we receive the same denial reason "" Unable to offer due to existing or prior relationship with Discover. '' I have spoken to quite a few reps and spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out an answer but can't receive a definitive answer. Are we both blacklisted from Discover now because our accounts were closed by Discover? One rep suggested applying in 7 years since thats when bad remarks fall of credit reports. However our Discover accounts never went to collections, never missed payments, weren't charged off. Just closed and either paid off or currently paying off. I called again and asked how long Discover keeps the "" Revoked/Closed '' Status in their system and was advised its permanent. Essentially my understanding is we will never be able to obtain a Discover card again if i am understanding correctly.",,DISCOVER BANK,MN,550XX,,Consent provided,Web,24-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3161539

28-02-2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Background : Home purchased in XX/XX/XXXX on an FHA XXXX Rehab loan using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Money Source appears to have purchased our debt, with an effective date of XX/XX/XXXX. Borrowers do not remember official notification or authorization for our account to be transferred. 

Significant Dates : ( D.1 ) XX/XX/XXXX : we received a bill from TMS with a significant change in our monthly amount due. My spouse contacted TMS ( XXXX ) to inquiry what changed. We discovered that there were discrepancies in the escrow account and that TMS would investigate. 
( D.2 ) XX/XX/XXXX : TMS ( XXXX ) contacted my spouse to inform us that our real estate tax wasnt entered correctly, and so TMS paid the bill. TMS then unilaterally developed a payment plan over 12 months which would increase our monthly payment by approximately $ 800/month. Paraphrasing from TMS ( XXXX ), TMS paid the bill, so you will be paying TMS back and now paying the correct payments towards escrow on future billing cycles. We explained that the significant change in monthly billing cycles is still unacceptable due to the significant financial hardship it would cause and that we should not be penalized for their error. TMS ( XXXX ) stated that she understood our concern and that the matter would be looked at further by TMS and someone would call us back. 
( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : Because no representatives from TMS had contacted us, my spouse called them to inquire what other options were available. Eventually, a supervisor/lead ( XXXX ) was placed in touch with my spouse. Paraphrasing TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) information was entered incorrectly, but we have to pay for the XXXX their ) deficiency. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then recommended that our insurance be lowered to decrease monthly bill cycles to compensate for the high monthly payment. Due to my status as active component military TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) also recommended that we pursue local tax exclusions/benefits to limit our monthly payments. Because of my spouses concern that our conflict was not being resolved, she asked for TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) to contact me ( primary borrower on account ). 
( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) contacts primary borrower via voicemail as requested, but fails to leave an extension number to be reached. I was on hold for approximately 38 minutes before being routed to an operator/customer care representative and then placed on hold for another approximate five minutes to contact the TMS Supervisor. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) apologized for the delay and failure to provide adequate contact information beyond I am the only ( XXXX ) in the department and one of four team leads. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then explained to the me ( primary borrower ) that the property taxes was not entered or calculated correctly, and that the responsibility rests with the borrower. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then again recommended that I adjust my insurance to compensate for the error, however, I see this as an inappropriate/unauthorized person directing what risks I should take as both an owner and borrower. He further recommended that I ask local authorities for exemptions due to my military status. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) offered to extend the re-payment to 24 or possibly 36 months to compensate for the escrow shortfall. I ( primary borrower ) requested additional documentation from TMS due to my concern about how, where, and why my payments were being used. I also stated that in my lay knowledge, I understood and considered TMS to be in multiple violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RSPCA ), especially in consideration of potentially improperly applying or crediting payments, neglecting to pay taxes, and failing to provide information on workout options. Additionally, I stated to TMS Supervisor that I may write a formal notice of error in accordance with the RSPCA and file a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if my lay research into the issue indicated that was appropriate to do so. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) explained that he understood, was sorry, and indicated that the mistake may have been TMS. Although the TMS Supervisor ( XXXXt ) was courteous and polite on the phone, I do not feel that he is/was enabled to remedy the problem in a manner that I feel is reasonable. 

Other concerns noted leading to decision to file complaint : ( C.1 ) TMS stated to spouse that they did not know they were responsible for property taxes or amount, but they had previously paid it. 
( C.2 ) Escrow account appears to be at a zero balance since the beginning of XXXX, but no notice was given to the borrower until a spike of monthly payments was encountered. 
( C.3 ) Escrow disbursements appear to be erratic.

( C.4 ) Length of time observed to review our account seems longer than necessary, which has placed consumer into danger of being significantly overdue on the account while the discrepancies are identified and rectified ( XXXX ) Following the XX/XX/XXXX escrow analysis, borrower paid minimum amount billed ( {$1800.00} ) or more for each billing cycle. Borrower was moderately delinquent on payment only once during the lifecycle of the mortgage, which was rectified once borrower was made away of a banking/funds error during a XXXX season. This delinquency was not significant enough to incur a late payment fee. 
( C.6 ) After researching similar complaints regarding TMS on the Consumer Complaint Database of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau , the borrower is concerned that this may be a trend for TMS ( example : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ).",,"MONEY SOURCE, THE",LA,701XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,28-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3165222

They returned a response of verified as accurate in which I am quite behooved. I myself contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and they were not able to validate this account. First off let me say I do not have an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did get approved for a car loan and did sign documents for the loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX Sent the check directly to the car dealership XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Fl XXXX XXXX ( Car Dealership seems to be Now closed down ) I was never delivered a vehicle and NEVER took possession of the vehicle. This was also known by bank rep XXXX who handled the loan process who in turn tried to contact the car dealership and was not able to locate the vehicle. XXXX and the dealership both confirmed to me that the check was received by the dealership in the amount of {$31000.00}, I have a voicemail recording from XXXX that will serve as proof that I NEVER taken possession of ANY vehicle. Fast forward a few months. I reached out to XXXX a few more times and to no avail was I able to reach him, even went into the local branch and was advised he was out to lunch. 
( I know feel as though he was avoiding my calls ) A few months later I check my credit report in the process of refinancing my home and I notice a collection/charge off in the amount of {$31000.00}. Mind you I was never sent a bill, statement, payment due notice, or past due notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I'm quite confused on how an account that is reporting as an auto loan didn't go through the repossession phase. How did it go straight to charge off if its indeed an auto loan? Wouldn't XXXX XXXX XXXX want possession back of a XXXX car that not being paid for? Clearly there is an error somewhere, and clearly XXXX XXXX XXXX KNEW that I NEVER took possession of that car and still trying to collect on the debt. They sent the check to the dealership, wouldn't that discrepancy be between the Bank and the Dealership? 
I contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX directly on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX talked with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX who all advised that I signed for a personal loan and not a auto loan which is why no repossession occured. So my question to them was why is it then reporting on my credit report as an auto loan? Clearly there is a numerous amount of errors in the reporting of this debt and I requested for Equifax to remove based on the FCRA violatons. I even noticed there is no dispute notation noted even after contacting XXXX XXXX XXXX via certified mail, I sent proof of the validation request, and a screenshot to Equifax showing no dispute notation and they are continuously responded back to my dispute as verfied WITHOUT launching a complete investigation into this matter.

Had to wait till Monday the XXXX for approval.They rejected it because they said the names don't match. Bank had my middle initial and my account with them don't. But later I found out both accounts had my full name. So I requested a wire transfer. They said it would go though by XXXX. Monday night I call and see what happened. They said there not sure to call back tomorrow. Tuesday XXXX at XXXX I call and they said everything is good .and at XXXX I call and check they said it didn't process because the bank I was wiring it to was on there blacklist. XXXX Bank. So I gave them another bank. Called back at XXXX. And they said it didnt process because the XXXX was wrong. Which it wasn't. So I sent in 2 more bank accounts. They said it would be tomorrow before it processes. Wednesday at XXXX and they said that the transfer is on hold and the rep on the phone refused to give me a reason why. Said someone will email me and let me know. Wednesday night still no word from ally. So I login in to my account and was able to electronically link one of my other banks. So I tried to do a ACH transfer and it gave me a error and said for me to call them so. I called. The rep. Did not know why it gave a error said my wire transfer is on hold did not know why. So I told him to cancel the wire and do a ACH to my bank that i just added for {$600.00} so he said ok and he put the request though. A few hours pass so I. check my account still no request on my account dashboard and on there website under FAQ its says to check the status online transfer to go look under activity. I look and still nothing So I go and do the request online and it accepted the request and waiting for approval. So today Thursday at XXXX I check my account and the request was rejected. I check my email and said that it was rejected because the ACH profile to that my linked bank account was dead. So i call again. And the rep XXXX XXXX out said that I wasn't getting my money today. And didn't give me a reason. Just wanted to know why I wanted to withdraw my money. Now my account is on restriction. Said I have to wait 10 days before I can withdraw. I asked him why my account dash board has my balance amount under the field line of cash available for with draw today. But you telling me it's not. He said that statement doesn't mean anything. It's just there. And then asked me if I wanted to do a stock trade or buy stock. I told him no he acted like I was breaking up and then hung up the phone. So at XXXX on XX/XX/2019 I log into the app to do a trade and says my account is not available for trade. So I call them again and ask why can't I trade he said because I have a pending with draw. I asked what withdraw because I thought all was rejected or canceled. He said you still have the {$600.00} ACH withdraw request to my linked bank account that the rep put in over the phone.. but that request is on hold and my account is restricted because of all the multiable request of withdraws. The thing that gets me is that the ACH withdraw that I put in online was rejected because the ACH profile was dead. If that's true then the ACH withdraw that the rep put in should have the same error. Because it's the same liked bank account. That they said the profile was dead on. But yet the transfer is on hold. Just does not make any since. 

I'm so sick of banks keeping my money from me.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s )  inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",,LEXISNEXIS,OH,440XX,,Consent provided,Web,25-04-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3222219

Again I explained that I have not received a statement and I made a payment on the phone with the representative who said the late fees would be waive and they would send me my statements. I have spoken with serveral supervisors who said they would 1 resolve the issue 2 remove my late fees and 3 remove the late payment remark from my credit report which has not been done.

Several hours later I was at the XXXX Dealership with the General Manager finalizing the transaction and called USAA Banking back to verify the Interest Rate and was told my rate would be 4.28 percent on borrowing {>= $1,000,000}. During this same call the USAA Representative was even nice enough to verify the monthly loan payments in terms of how much of a down payment I was going to make on the purchase. The following Tuesday XX/XX/2019 I recontacted USAA to find out the status of my loan and was told that I was approved but the interest rate would now be 4.74 percent. There was NO immediate explanation given until I escalated my complaint to a manger who informed me that because my credit score was ONLY XXXX the interest rate was raised. I deem this to be deceptive business practices and blatantly just fraud. USAA Has refused to speak with the USAA Representative who quoted me 4.28 percent so as to verify that I was told my loan Rate was 4.28 percent.

Because the amount exceeded the mobile deposit limit by {$340.00}, I called support and asked for an increase. They told me that they did not provide increases above the amount I had. They suggested I cash the check elsewhere. The mobile app gave instructions for deposit by mail. It listed two addresses, one was a PO BOX , and the other was for overnight delivery. I endorsed the check and mailed it out two-day priority mail to the overnight address. 

Using the tracking number, I discovered it was not delivered until Monday, rather than Friday as promised. On the app, the instructions for deposit by mail clearly state '' Once your check has been received, up to {$200.00} of your check deposit funds will generally be available within one business day. The remainder will generally be available after another business day. Check deposit amounts greater than {$5000.00} may be held for an extended period. '' So, I called on Tuesday, XX/XX/18, which was one business day after the date it was delivered since there was no indication that the check had been received. The agent I spoke with told me that she could not confirm receipt of the deposit, and she told me she could give me no time frame for how long it would take and that they would know it was deposited when it showed on my account. I asked could they not at least confirm it was received at the correct address. She told me that she could not. I asked what remedy I had and she assured me that it would be processed soon. 

I called today, XX/XX/18, a full two business days after they received it according to USPS, and the agent placed me on hold and told me that "" in her experience, it can take three business days before it is processed or shown in the account. '' I asked could she not confirm it with the processing center that the check was received so I don't have to worry that it was delivered to the incorrect address. She told me that she "" could not check with the processing center until 10 business days after the tracking number delivery date. '' So, I am going into XXXX without any access to my funds, and also without having any idea whether the check was received at the correct address. None of this information was available to me or I would not have deposited the check via mail.

On XX/XX/19 I rec 'd a notice from Equifax alerting me to a change on my credit report. I checked my report via my XXXX XXXX XXXX acct. and found that my address had been reverted to an old address for some unknown reason. I contacted the company because I was concerned. I had changed my address when I moved in XX/XX/2019. My banks and my credit cards had all been updated with my new address and it had been reflected on my credit report.

However, when I began a new job in XX/XX/2019 there was an incident that could have made my personal ID info. vulnerable - they emailed an I-9 form with all of my identifying info. via insecure lines. 

In any event when spoke to a some Equifax repXXXX in XXXX and explained my concern he said it was nothing to worry about and to ignore the alert. 

Sure enough on XX/XX/19 I received a second alert - checked my ount and found the same issue - my old address appearing as my current address. 

I called Equifax again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with someone named XXXX who said he would place a dispute on my credit report in an effort to remove the old address. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received the first of several emails saying that the dispute had been completed and offering me a confirmation number by which I could check the status of the dispute. I have tried several times to log onto the status check website offered by Equifax to no avail. When I provide my identifying information I receive an error notice saying the information does not match their records. 

I have spent the last hour on the phone trying to reach someone who can help me with this. The first person with whom I spoke transferred me to the "" dispute center '' where I spoke with a rep. named "" XXXX '' who asked me for my DOB, my address, info. about current credit cards and about past student loans ( which I paid off over 10 years ago ) and she was not satisfied. I then asked for a supervisor. She placed me on hold for over 10 minutes. I gave up and called back and reached XXXX. They transferred me to U.S. dispute dept. where I spoke with XXXX who said she would transfer me to a supervisor. I was placed on hold for over ten minutes and then disconnected. 

I called back again. Now speaking with XXXX - who said she was going to transfer me to a supervisor in the dispute department but after 15 minutes of hold time a customer service rep. in "" products and solutions '' picked up and had to transfer me again. 

I hung up. I want this issue cleared up. This company is a joke and has wasted my time and screwed up my report.
