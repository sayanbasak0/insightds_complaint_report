01-03-2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"In 2016, I was charged over {$1700.00} in overdraft charges after chase bank removed my access to mobile bank deposits. I have recorded conversations with bank employees, recorded with their consent, explicitly stating that the feature was removed due to low funding levels in my account, though no official guidelines were ever presented to me, despite multiple requests. My complaint is split into two parts : 1. ) Chase Bank utilized predatory tactics to remove mobile deposit from consumers who would most benefit from the feature. I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. 

2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights, as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature. While in my recordings bank employees give vastly different answers about the terms of use, none could provide me with clear written rules. Who qualifies for that feature? When will mine be turned on? Why was the feature removed as a result of overdraft fees? All indicated that the feature was removed due to low funds or overdrafts, but none could explain why removal came as a consequence of those facts. Several employees agreed that this was an unfair practice and indicated that numerous customers called in with similar complaints over time. The second portion of my complaint is thus about the bank 's lack of transparency about customer terms of use. 

My recorded conversations with employees are from XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/2016, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, and XX/XX/16. In total, throughout that period I was assessed {$1700.00} in fees, though {$500.00} were refunded by employees who agreed that I had done all I could to avoid them.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,770XX,,Consent provided,Web,01-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3166742

12-01-2019,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"In early XXXX, I ran into some financial trouble because my PNC bank account did not update on mobile banking over XXXX XXXX. This overdrew my account on the following Tuesday and because I was out of town and not working at the time, I had to wait 2 weeks for a paycheck to bring my account back to balance. I accrued over a XXXX dollars in overdraft and NSF fees and have records to prove this. I called PNC multiple times and asked of anything could be done to stop this with zero help. I was transferred to a supervisor department after the 1st employees claimed they could not reverse any of the fees as the system would not let them. The phone rang once and I got an automated message that said no one was available and the call automatically ended. Never called back. Accepting that they would not budge to work with me or help me at all, I paid the fees and brought my account back to positive and moved on. 

Fast forward to today. The company I work for has decided to switch to biweekly pay instead of weekly. These past 2 weeks on one weeks pay have been awful and stressful. However, we managed to make it to Thursday XX/XX/19 without overdrawing. My account was negative XXXX dollars on Thursday XX/XX/19. When I woke up on Friday XX/XX/19 my account was negative XXXX because of a few small transactions that went through and XXXX dollars in overdraft fees 3 XXXX  dollar charges each. So, my paycheck finally hit the account for XXXX dollars on Friday XX/XX/19. Then at XXXX on Saturday XX/XX/19 I was charged 3 more XXXX dollar overdraft fees after my paycheck had already hit the account. Because my paycheck has gone through I did not expect this. I have so many bills coming out this week from having to wait 2 weeks to get paid, that I can not afford XXXX dollars in overdraft fees. This is my whole grocery budget for the next 2 weeks until I get paid again and I literally have no food in my apartment. I called again today XX/XX/19 asking for assistance in this especially because my paycheck had hit and there is no reason for the fees to be met with no help again and told I should use tips to avoid overdrafting. Enough is enough of this. Ive paid so much in overdraft fees that I can't afford to live. All I want was the 3 most recent overdraft fees refunded to me so I can afford groceries so I don't starve without over drafting again and having the same thing happen while I wait another 2 weeks to get paid. I have exhausted all options to avoid this. I have overdraft protection on my account. I have alerts sent to me when my account drops below XXXX dollars. The way PNC does their business makes it impossible to avoid this because it happens over night while you are sleeping and then to offer no solution to a good, 6 year customer is frustrating and disheartening.",,PNC Bank N.A.,WI,531XX,,Consent provided,Web,12-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3123079

22-07-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"On XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX  notified me by email ( see attachments ) that my loan was being sold ( transferred ) to M & T Bank as of XX/XX/2019. I did not ask for this to happen, neither did I want to do business with M & T Bank, although I realized the sale was legal. 

The email notice said that I "" would not have to change any of the terms '' of my payments and simply continue as I had been doing, the only change being payments made to M & T Bank rather than XXXX. On Friday, XX/XX/2019, I received a 2nd email notice from M & T Bank basically stating the exact same thing. 

For the last 5 or more years, I had been making my XXXX XXXX payments through my XXXX XXXX Bill Payment System ( see attachments ). Payments were being made at least twice a month or every two ( 2 ) weeks consistently. I have NEVER made payments late in over 10 years with any mortgage payment and usually make the 2nd payment in a month ( prior month to due date ) at least 1 to 3 days early. My wife and I earn over {$180000.00} per year and do not have any issues making any debt payment!

At the time the transfer became effective, I had already paid XXXX XXXX  for the month of XXXX as I always due before the end of the previous month. M & T Bank sent me a bill not giving me credit for XX/XX/2019 payments that had already been made to XXXX XXXX prior to the transfer. Secondly, since I thought this was an error, I waited for a corrected statement. Instead, I received a pass due notice when my XXXX payment was not even due! 

I called M & T Bank on last Friday, XX/XX/2019 and explained everything above to the representative. Instead of assisting me with the issue, she kept giving me the run around and telling me that I had "" to change the way I was paying by logging on and signing up for their every-two-week payment bank draft ''. This was a direct contradiction to what I had been guaranteed in writing that I would NOT have to change the way I had been paying my mortgage properly for years. Secondly, she did nothing to bring my mortgage account current as it should be. 

Lastly, I just received by mail another pass due notice stating that I owe {$2900.00}, when in fact, I OWE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! The M & T Bank bill also included some {$920.00} "" Hazard Disbursement '' amount, which has never appeared on any previous mortgage bill, and they never explained it to me. 

My payments are current, and documentation is attached to prove it! If I were not late with XXXX XXXX, how could I now be late with M & T Bank when I have continued to make all payments twice a month or even every two weeks right through their transfer of mortgage process, for which again, I did not ask nor desire? 

This is absolutely ridiculous, and I expect the federal government to take the strongest possible action against this bank. They did not even listen to me or even try to correct the situation. I have been a perfect customer, I always pay all bills on time ( my credit score proves that ), and I will not tolerate this harassment in the lease.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Sierra Pacific Mortgage stating some conditions for PMI removal. Among those conditions were that a ) for primary residences loans, less than 5 years old require LTV of 75 % and b ) for multi-family residences the required LTV is 70 %.  They also stated I would have to pay for an appraisal. 

My mortgage disclosures from Sierra Pacific at the time of my mortgage closing very specifically state that my required LTV is 80 %, at which time I can request PMI be removed. The Sierra Pacific Mortgage website for my loan also states this 80 % LTV. 

At no point prior to receiving their letter was any 70 % or 75 % LTV requirement mentioned. 

I called Sierra Pacific repeatedly to address this issue. I talked the front line support about this and they would not put me in touch with the PMI department. They told me my PMI cancellation request was denied and that I needed a mortgage balance of {$440000.00} ( 70 % ) LTV to remove PMI ( my property is a two flat ). 

At this point I escalated the issue to a supervisor ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I was transferred to XXXX XXXX. He told me that he would reach out to the PMI department and get me more information in 3-5 days. I called XXXX XXXX on his direct line ( XXXX ) and left him message on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. He did not answer or return any of my calls.

XXXX advised no documents were received and provided a little more detail into possibilities of someone else attempting to retrieve or access my account. He did not or could not provide specifics. He sent me a new link to provide my documents and waiting on the call with me to confirm receipt. He was not able to confirm receipt since the documents again were not received. He was going to consult another party to confirm if there was a technical issue to explain why my documents were not being received. Then, the call disconnected. 

I can not begin to express to you how perplexing, concerning, and frustrating this has become to me as a long-standing Capital One customer. I may not have thousands of dollars of CC activity each year but I am definitely a customer who pays their bills and is paying monthly interest on my credit cards. I NEED someone to explain to me the specifics of the current restricted status of my accounts. I NEED someone to confirm receipt of my previous 2 submissions. I do not think it is too much to ask especially since it is MY personal information Capital One is requesting and asking me to compile without giving me any details. It is an odd way to do business and definitely lacks transparency. 

I noticed the restricted message on my Capital One mobile app when I was checking the status of my autopay. There has been no verbal or written outreach by Capital One to me to advise or inform about the status of my account either.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,OR,973XX,,Consent provided,Web,30-01-2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3137137

When I called Chase to ask for my reimbursement, they said that there was nothing they can do about it.

During the process of the loan consolidation, I indicated that I was unemployed and submitted an app for an Income based repayment on XX/XX/18 ; along with the app, I uploaded my spouse paystub to my online account with XXXX as directed by a representative. I received a text message from fedloan stating In order for my Income repayment plan to be considered I needed to upload supporting documents so I called in twice, once in XX/XX/XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX regarding this uploaded paystub ; I notified the reps each time that I had already submitted the paystub and each time it was confirmed they could see the paystub.On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification the consolidation was completed with no mention of the income repayment plan. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another text from XXXX stating my payment is coming due on XX/XX/XXXX, etc. so I logged into my account to see why I had a payment due when I had applied for a repayment based on my unemployment. When I logged in I see a notice stating I needed to provide a paystub for my repayment plan so again, I call into customer service and the rep tells me it was denied because they didn't know how often my spouse was paid. Once I told him where to find this information on the stub he advised me he would resend the app for review ; I was never notified or contacted about this missing information until I reached out to them to check on the status. As of today,, XX/XX/2018 my account is now showing in a 5 day delinquent status. I sent an email ON XX/XX/18 inquiring about the status of my repayment plan and the reply back On XX/XX/18 stated it's still pending as of XX/XX/XXXX and not the original date I submitted it months ago.

Sincerely, XXXX, XXXX SOC SEC # XXXX DOB XX/XX/XXXX ADDRESS XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX All furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies must comply with all applicableregulations. Information about applicable regulations currently in effect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's website, www.consumerfinance.govXXXX 
NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. Sections 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. section 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is available at the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document.

Section 623 imposes the following duties upon furnishers : Accuracy Guidelines The FCRA requires furnishers to comply with federal guidelines and regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. Federal regulations and guidelines are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623 ( e ).

General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ).

Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute From Consumer If a consumer notifies a furnisher, at an address specified by the furnisher for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

Furnishers must comply with federal regulations that identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer. Under these regulations, furnishers must complete an investigation within 30 days ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information ) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a "" credit repair organization. '' Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ). Federal regulations are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute From Consumer Reporting Agency If a CRA notifies a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by thefurnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must : Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ).

Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section 623 ( b ) ( 2 ).

Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ).

Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ).

Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's file. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to "" nationwide '' consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA. Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The CFPB has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information.

Duties When ID Theft Occurs All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each CRA of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615 ( f ).

The CFPB 's website, www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore, has more information about the FCRA, including publications for businesses and the full text of the FCRA.

XXXX, the loan servicer for the U.S. Department of Education stated by letter that the loan would be reported to credit reporting agencies as discharged. TransUnion continues to report the loan as an unresolved dispute, not specified. Furthermore, since the loan was connected to a proven fraudulent student loan history that is massive known fraudulent signatories and a wrong university I never attended, I requested that the loan be removed from all credit reports and not re-posted. Additionally, TransUnion re-posted a phone number that was disconnected more than 3 years ago after removing it and informing me by letter that no phone numbers would be put on my credit report. I asked all credit reporting agencies to not post any phone numbers to my credit reports since I change the number frequently, sometimes 4 times in a month. All credit reporting agencies have compiled with the request to remove outdated, inaccurate information, and also, removed the student loan that is no longer subject to monitoring and thus no longer subject to being reported - every credit reporting agency except for TransUnion.

09-01-2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I dont know where to start with this company. Everything started when I filed for homestead on my home. My realtor and mortgage broker advised me it would decrease my payments. I did everything I was told to do, by county and mortgage company in XXXX of 2018. I called Primary Resediential Mortgage 2 times that month for directions for filing homestead and then to confirm EVERYTHING was received. I got a confirmation that everything was in and great. Fast forward to XXXX when I get a letter in the mail that an escrow analysis was ran and caused my mortgage to increase because my property taxes increased to over {$2000.00}. I was beside myself, called PRMI and they said that I didnt send in the right info for my homestead and they found my property taxes raised to {$2000.00}. I submitted to PRMI my tax form I received in the mail showing y taxes were only going to be the high of {$1300.00}. I sent the them the confirmation and they re- ran the analysis and called me back and said good news, its going down. PRMI sent me a check said were all good, we wont run your analysis again for another year. So naturally, I cash this check and move on with life. 

Let me add in, in the middle of all this I had to speak with a manager because every rep I worked with couldnt do anything but read a script and understand the problem with my analysis. I spoke with XXXX XXXX which I will provide the emails sent to me from him. The first time I spoke with Jaes he advised would have to call me back the next day. I accepted. Well I guess that was the wrong thing to do, after not hearing from him I called back. The rep I spoke with said he wasnt in the office and he told her to just send me an email. Thats highly unacceptable, I demanded to speak with him. They finally transferred me over to him and he had the nerve to tell me that he was leaving out of town that next day and just didnt have time to talk to me. What a manager, I would review his status with the company. Well finally he sent me an email confirming everything was great the next day and what my new mortgage payment would be. Also, in this email he highlighted how his company provided me all incorrect information about my homestead and escrow payments and apologized for their mistake. 

To add to this problem I had in XXXX, I asked the 3 times about my homeowners insurance because I kept getting cancellation notices in the mail. Every single time they would say well look into it. I live in Florida, in the middle of hurricane season and they cant even get making a payment right? 

Well after I FINALLY had all of this settled I thought I could continue through the year without having to call this company. Well, I was wrong again. Fast forward now to XXXX, I receive a letter in the mail again from Primary Residential mortgage Inc and they said that my escrow analysis was going to be ran AGAIN and my mortgage will increase AGAIN! I got on the phone right away again and spoke with a rep who assured me that thats an automated message they have to send out and assured me that no, they only run it one a year and thats for next year. Silly me, I believe her and went about my life. Fast forward now to XXXX and I receive an actual new escrow analysis AGAIN raising my mortgage. I get back on the phone again and immediately ask for a manager. Well I get XXXX again. XXXX says he has to review my account and XXXX call back again in 2 business days. Why should it take that long, research now I asked. He said well today is over and I just dont have the time. When Im at work my day isnt over until I clock out and being as you guys were still in business hours I should have been taken care of. I accepted and advised okay call me tomorrow. 

The day came, XXXX called back. I spoke with XXXX and all he had to say was because I closed on my house on XXXX ( which I didnt, closed in XXXX ) they always run an escrow 12 months after closing. He then started to say that Primary residential hasnt done anything wrong and I just have to live with it. 

Well this is where I have stopped with this company. At this time, I just want to sell my house, refinance, anything to get away from this horrible company. It has been 12 months and I have had to call this comp at every single month since XXXX! A mortgage company shouldnt be able to raise and lower my mortgage at their pleasure every single month. Also, I shouldnt have to worry whether my insurance will be paid for my home.

24-02-2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To whom it may concern, I am writing this complaint and addressing "" Experian, XXXX  and XXXX  who are three of the elite credit bureau agencies who ultimately has a stronghold over your life by reporting credit information. To begin I am very VERY disappointed and dissatisfied with the way that Experian, XXXX and XXXX runs and conducts business. They are supposed to by LAW report ACCURATE and updated information regarding individuals credit files as well as conduct ACTUAL investigations so they will only be reporting fair and ACCURATE information according to the FCRA. 

However stating these facts it has come to my knowledge that these Credit Agencies are NOT conducting business as they should by law. I have been disputing the item listed below for approximately 5 months now with no correct resolution which is removal from my credit report. Please note that Experian, XXXX, XXXX nor any one speaking for or on the behalf of each company can say otherwise due to the fact that I do send and retain all of my dispute letters and responses on top of me ALWAYS sending my dispute letters via Certified Mail. The item listed below is and has been due for removal for a numerous amount of reasons. Please also note that all three Credit Bureaus always CLAIM that they have done an investigation which I know is not true and the reasons are listed below for the creditor. 

CREDITOR : 1. "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' : To begin, This item should have been removed from my Credit files due to it being PAST the Nevada statute of Limitations, and not to forget to mention that with this creditor I have absolutely no ties with or contract with. Also I have the paperwork that this creditor sent me which is absolutely FALSE AND COUNTERFEIT ( also sent to Experian, XXXX and XXXX in a prior dispute )! There are incorrect dates that do not correlate with the actual information and reporting, The "" Date of Contract '' clashes and voids the actual initial paperwork given ( which is counterfeit, against the law and considered erroneous information which each company should have noticed upon their "" dispute investigation '' ). If you look at the "" contract '' that this company sent to me you will notice that on page 1 of 6 ( which they did not send me all 6 pages of ) for the "" Date of Lease Contract '' ( when the Lease Contract is filled out ) it states the Date of XX/XX/XXXX which is not possible due to the fact on Page 6 of 6 ( what seems to be the contract signing page ) states that it was signed on XX/XX/XXXX. If you look closely to the left side of this sign date is physically states "" Date form is filled out ( same as top of page 1 ) '' Which it does not. That leads and proves that this document is counterfeit erroneous information as well as making the contract VOID! Also I would like to point out even more erroneous and information referring back to page 1 of 1 of the document sent to me from the creditor. If you refer to section 6 of the document you will see that it states the "" Rent and Charges '' are a total of {$790.00} for the total lease period. Now if you will refer to the document with the Header "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) '' noted below to the right it gives a list of all dates and amounts ( which again clashes, voids and proves that XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as the credit bureaus are reporting false information. ). This brings me to point out the incorrect information on this document in regards to my credit file. My move in date on this document states I moved in XX/XX/XXXX and my "" Lease End Date '' was XX/XX/XXXX with my rent being {$970.00}. Also please be aware that if and as shown that my Lease date ended on XX/XX/XXXX how is it possible that this creditor is showing on my credit report with an opened date of XX/XX/XXXX on Experian and XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX when I had already moved out? The answer is it's not. Everything about this item on my credit is totally bogus, out of the Statute of limitations, erroneous and counterfeit information and needs to be removed. Nothing matches and some how it is still being reported on my Credit reports which is absolutely unacceptable.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NV,890XX,,Consent provided,Web,24-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3161288

Experian, XXXX XXXX and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from Experian and XXXX was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote Experian and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only Experian wrote back a letter dated XXXX stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

XXXX XXXX never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with XXXX, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because Experian, XXXX  and XXXX XXXX all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I. I demand that these items on my account that was not verified be removed from my account because they are in violation of my rights and not to mention, XXXX XXXX did not even respond to my investigation request.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NY,109XX,,Consent provided,Web,08-07-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3299386

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.

I have formally disputed the charge, as I do not agree that XXXX XXXX    XXXX should have sent any bill at all. I have always paid all my bills, and of much larger amounts.I keep getting calls, and I have repeatedly requested agents from Capital Accounts to stop calling me. However, they keep calling, and are rude, and it seems their only goal is to harass me. Here is a brief summary : 1. I have a child with XXXX XXXX, and it takes specialized experience in dealing with such children to be able to Consult and treat them 2. When I took my daughter ( my son 's sister ) for her annual exam, I inquired at the office, and they informed me that their doctors have experience and will be able to examine my son 3. When I visited them with my son, the doctor was unable to do any exam on my  son and finally gave up saying he needs to be examined under XXXX. 
4. They handed me a 'treatment plan ' that required me to pay thousands of dollars. 
5. Subsequently, they sent me a bill saying that since they were not able to do a comprehensive exam ( which is covered by insurance ), they called it a limited exam. My point was that the doctor never really examined the child at all - and the doctor clearly had no experience dealing with Children with XXXX XXXX. Something the office made me believe to set me up for the appointment.

They used a third party XXXX XXXX to verify a Bankruptcy who is not the originator of the debt. 

More so Experian unfortunately told a complete lie on their verification methods. I suppressed the XXXX XXXX file on XX/XX/XXXX also requested my report.

I immediately knew this inquiry was initiated by an unknown individual who has been using my SS # to work in the state of Colorado. I have never lived in Colorado. I immediately sent a dispute to Equifax but within a day I but when I attempted to logon to check the status of the challenge I was unable to. The account in question was set up in XXXX, Colo. I have no Colorado address on my credit report. I believe I have a fraud alert on this account as well. So, when XXXX went to verify the credit report, the discrepancy should have been noted. I have tried to resolve this with XXXX as well with no luck. I even did a second dispute with Equifax and the same thing happened when I tried to check the outcome of the investigation. I received an error message saying I am unable to access my account.

I called the Bank which was Chase and ask about it, the agent told me that all my credit cards from Chase were closed and that no information can be disclosed until I will receive a letter about it. 
I had 5 chase credit card, the Chase Business Ink, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, the Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Chase Hyatt Credit card, and the Chase Ihg credit card. In addition, my wife that was an authorized user on one of my cards, got her only card closed ( the Chase Sapphire Preferred card ). 
Chase claim was that I was requesting too many credit cards in a short time and that was a payment made from another company once. 
Although I had these 5 cards with Chase, they were open over a long period of time ( 4 years ) and they had different purposes. I always paid my bills on time and never had high spending on those cards. My incomes were high enough to justify all the credit limit I had. 
I did pay off once my balance with a check from a company, this was because I had a contract with them and some of my expenses that occurred during my work with them were paid with my personal credit card. It was normal to reimburse these expenses directly from the company 's check. 
I called Chase many time and spoke with many representatives but no one was able to help me with this. 
I'm reaching out to you to help me with that.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,112XX,,Consent provided,Web,06-06-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3266381

Not only did they review and accept the contract, they had me, complete an inspection, secure an attorney, and purchase a condo questionnaire. My realtor sent emails to ensure that we were on track and we never got a no. There have been so many complaints online regarding naca but I still tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. There lack of responsiveness and perceived lack of care frustrated both my realtor and attorney. There has been constant mixed messages and doesnt seem like this program has any empathy for their clients. They seem to be preying on neighborhood clients versus helping them. Even after denying me, they still proceeded to take out fraudulent membership dues and money for a credit report. If you deny me of a loan I get approved for by the alternate lenders in 5 min. I sent a complaint to XXXX  and NACA for a refund of the fees over the last year and they denied me again. They dont think there is anything wrong with there process and the offered no help at all instead went back and forth with me in an email war to try and prove he was right without even picking up the phone to talk to me. This is the second time that naca nearly caused me to lose a home. The first offer I submitted, was denied by the seller because they didnt want to work with naca due to a reputation of the process taking too long. They asked me to switch  lenders and they would consider. Believing in naca, I stayed the course until I realized they werent really trying to help me. They never even offered an alternate solution.

I have tried to contact 745 Cash several times to resolve and they will no longer return my phone calls. They have violated the Tennessee  Consumer Protection Act, as well as, The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act under Federal Law. 

They took money from an account that they had no authorization to take. I have requested the loan paperwork, signed check and audio recording where they claim I gave them permission to deduct {$480.00} from my checking account. They have not provided the below documentations under my requests, because they do not exist. They had my current debit card on file for future payments that I would authorize. I'm on their recording saying I would call back to make the payment, I did not give them permission to take money from my account at their leisure. They also nullified the original loan agreement by accepting the first {$50.00} payment on what was supposed to be a biweekly payment plan. They had no legal right to access my checking account that the payday loan was not originally affiliated with. 

Emails are attached where my financial institution states that they've spoken with a representative from 745 Cash and that 745 Cash was working on refunding me back. 

Again, I am requesting the following : *paperwork that shows that a payday loan was taken out on my XXXX XXXX XXXX account *the cancelled check from XXXX XXXX XXXX for which they assessed me a bounced check fee *the audio recording where I gave permission to deduct {$480.00} from my account, or the recording where I gave them permission to access my account at their leisure *Refunded back the amount that they were not authorized to take as well as the two overdraft charges ( {$36.00} each ) that they incurred, totaling {$520.00} In accordance with the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act, they are required to provide the above, failure to do so will result in further legal action.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Golden Title Loans LLC,TN,,,Consent provided,Web,10-01-2020,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3492140

I also requested that this company send me a copy of the original creditors documentation, or ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as they are required under FCRA to keep a copy in their files to verify that this information is mine and correct. THEY DID NOT DO ANY OF THE ABOVE. Under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA they are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. Pursuant to section 605B they are required to BLOCK the fraudulent information on my credit report resulting from identity theft within 4 business days and notify the furnisher of that information, in which they HAVE NOT DONE! THE LAW IS VERY CLEAR AND THEY FAIL TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW. I have made MULTIPLE attempts to have them delete these fraudulent accounts that were the result of identity theft, off of my credit report, yet the accounts still remain, and this company continues to violate my rights under FCRA.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,773XX,,Consent provided,Web,02-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3167659

13-03-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"SPS 2nd : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Before we begin it is important to note that SPS services both the 1st and 2nd loans on this property, and that they belong to different investors, with differing guidelines, that are in conflict with one another. This creates many problems when it comes to short sales, or any other type of negotiation, as they can not best protect either investor in a situation where the demands from each investor require the other to lower their net proceeds. SPS does not allow a prospective buyer to bring in additional monies to satisfy a demand from a junior lien holder, and in the State of California, a seller is never allowed to contribute any monies to satisfy demands. So that means the offer on the table is the only amount of money we have to work with to satisfy all liens on a property. 

The time line below shows the level of gross incompetence and possible purposeful negligence of the underwriting department in the review for loss mitigation on BOTH loans for this property. I have highlighted with *** the particularly problematic issues and communications. They have 2 sets of rules that are in direct conflict with one another. They should have known that there was no way for them to work out this loss mitigation file. 

XX/XX/XXXX Submitted to SPS offer was {$430000.00} XX/XX/XXXX Got value back of XXXX. We were asked to increase the net but not told what they required. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called the SPS Ombudsman to see if they could find out what the minimum required net is, and they were unable to tell me. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We sent market comps and an inspection report to support our offer of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Rep at ombudsmans office said we were about 6k off minimum net required. We revised the HUD to reflect an increase to the net proceeds to the 1st trust deed by XXXX and sent that back to SPS XX/XX/XXXX Per Ombudsman, no response to our higher net. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called ombudsman, no response. Ombudsman sent message to underwriting to please get response XXXX Per the Ombudsman, underwriting somehow managed to close the review on XXXX yet the ombudsman never got notice of that, and wasn't apparent in the database. Instead, underwriting approved the XXXX 's for a repayment plan. The ombudsman can do NOTHING until one of the XXXX 's call in to decline that repayment on a recorded line. they can call the ombudsman to do so, to make sure it gets done right. we need to send all short and offer docs again to both XXXX and XXXX along with a letter requesting rush review due to us thinking we were in review for an entire month and no one ever told us we weren't. 

XX/XX/XXXX Resubmitted entire file and the homeowner called the ombudsman to decline payment plan that was never requested. 

XX/XX/XXXX Per XXXX in the Ombudsman department, the underwriter on the 1st denied the offer again wanting a further increased net. Yet again, they refused to provide us what net they wanted, making this a very frustrating guessing game for the buyers and the sellers. 

XX/XX/XXXX We increased the net again, and resubmitted the new offer. 

XX/XX/XXXX Underwriting for the 2nd demanded a corrected RMA and we sent that back on the same day XX/XX/XXXX Ombudsman told us that both loans were active in short sale review. 

XX/XX/XXXX We were told it looked like the 1st and 2nd were negotiating between each other and to expect decision by XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Finally got word that the investor for the 1st Trust Deed approved the short sale and that now the file can go to the investor to the 2nd for approval. As is normal for ALL short sales we do with SPS, the net to the 2nd was {$8500.00}. It is important to note here, that SPS never allows more than XXXX to go to a junior lien on any short sale, except in some GSE situations where the guidelines state the maximum is XXXX. We were told by SPS that they had internally approved the 2nd and just needed investor signoff. 
XXXX We were now told that the 2nd is requiring no less than 25,000 to approve the short sale, on a loan of XXXX. This is where the conflict of interest comes into play when the same company is servicing the 1st and 2nd for different investors. In NO short sale would SPS ever allow 30 % of the UPB to go to a 2nd when the 1st is still short. We were asked to revise the HUD showing XXXX to the 2nd. At that point I informed the Ombudsman that I believe we would then have a problem with the 1st, as we had already been fighting over meeting their net proceeds and per their investors policy of not allowing any 3rd party including the buyer or agents to contribute to satisfy junior liens, and the State of Californias law that sellers may not contribute in a short sale, this would then result in a substantial decrease to the net on the 1st. Ombudsman still asked us to send the HUD showing increased net to the 2nd, and decreased net to the 1st. We sent it same day. 

XXXX Ombudsman confirmed receipt of new HUD and attached it to both accounts. 

XXXX Ombudsman escalated issue again for resolution on the issues with both the 1st and 2nd nets. 
**** At this point I started calling twice a day for updates**** XX/XX/XXXX Still nothing back explained to ombudsman that based on the 1st TD approval letter and the verbal that the 2nd had been internally approved, that the buyer started working on their loan. Now their rate lock is expiring and asked them to please escalate again. Was told that they would attempt to escalate this to the highest level of management to get it going. Was also reassured that the issues for the 1st and the 2nd were escalated and tied together. 

XXXX Was told investor for 2nd has approved the file, but it needed to go through QC and there was nothing they could do regarding the net issues for the 1st until the letter for the 2nd had been issued even though we had been told repeatedly that they were escalated TOGETHER. 

XX/XX/XXXX Was told that the ombudsman had this escalated to the highest level and they send a message to find out what was taking so long. 

XX/XX/XXXX. Was told by ombudsman department that it had notes in the system for the 2nd from the 8th that it was being worked on by XXXX. 

XXXX Was told by ombudsman that this had only been sent to QC on the XXXX. We asked how that could possibly be the case and referenced our previous notes, we were then told it had failed QC on the XXXX but there were no notes as to why and that it was sent back to QC on the XXXX and escalated again. 

XXXX. Was told that the 2nd TD NEVER SENT THE FILE TO THE INVESTOR. They had NO EXPLANATION about all the times I was told it was approved and the approval letter was in the QC department. At this point it is obvious that we have been lied to throughout the entire process with SPSs 2nd TD department. ************Keep in mind we started this short sale with SPS on XX/XX/XXXX, so we have been LIED TO FOR OVER FOUR MONTHS. They have harmed not only their own investor ( s ) and their borrower, but also the buyer as they are preventing them from finding another property in this difficult market. 

I want SPS fined to the maximum amount allowed by law, I want the conflict of interest investigated and I want the short sale approved AS IT STANDS for both the 1st and the 2nd liens and I want SPS to be required to make up the difference for their investors.

Research revealed that these 2 entities are owned by the parent company known as XXXX XXXX , XXXX . These 2 entities are XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX  XXXX. These debts are not mine, yet they appear on my credit bureau file ( s ) as charged off debts. 

The XXXX XXXX account appears with a balance due of {$150.00}. I have never had an account with this organization. The XXXX XXXX XXXX account appears on my credit bureau file ( s ) as an Unsecured loan account with a charged off balance of {$410.00}. I have never obtained a loan from this organization and based on the corporate description, was unaware that they offered such services. 

In correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX ; I requested proof of my obligation to pay from both of these organizations. They responded with a letter requesting that I send them a police report for identity theft. I responded with a second letter dated XX/XX/XXXX again requesting validation in the form of ANY application for an account for credit or a contract bearing my signature. They both responded on XX/XX/XXXX with a print out of a bill ; which according to an FTC opinion letter is NOT sufficient proof that a debt belongs to a particular individual. 

According to the FCRA these debts have not been proven to belong to me and should therefore be removed from all 3 credit reporting agencies files. Subsequent requests for the same have not been honored by the credit bureas or by either of these organizations. The credit bureaus continue to report these debts as mine and I have also requested thier Method of Verification for these debts which they have yet to provide. A subsequent complaint regarding the actions or inaction of the 3 major credit bureaus is forthcoming. Additionally, I have a filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) in Wisconsin and am planning to file a complaint with the Texas Attorney General 's Office.",,"Colony Brands, Inc.",TX,797XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05-02-2018,Untimely response,No,N/A,2788361

I am requesting an audit of the reporting history of fifteen federal student loan accounts held by Nelnet, and the three credit bureaus update their records according to the complete account history ; ( XXXX ), that includes all historical data, date opened, and historical timeline, and the loans are paid and consolidated. 

The loans have been consolidated XX/XX/XXXX to a different servicer. 

Customer service representatives at Nelnet said to me that disputing information to the credit bureau will cause credit score decreases because they will respond that the information was frivolous and accurate. This also indicated to me problems with the servicers dispute and resolution process and what procedures they use in cases of disputed accuracy and my rights under Federal law including the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

The negative balance associated with this account was well over {$1000.00}. I was fully unaware of the negative status of this account, and certainly had no idea that it had been charged off. I am still unsure of how it is legal for a bank to allow such an excessive charge to pass through, when there is no money in said account. In the terms of our divorce decree, it is stipulated that any and all debts incurred during the time of our legal separation are the financial responsibility of the party who acquired them. These charges were incurred solely by my ex-husband, and the bank associate even confirmed that it was clear to her, that the only debit card in use was his own personal card. Mine was entirely inactive. Even after calling in and pleading my case with the bank and offering to provide proof in the form of divorce documents, there was no consideration made to removing me from the liability of this debt. This debt affects me in two critical ways : I am unable to obtain any new bank accounts in the future until this debt is fully paid, and secondly, it is strongly impacting my credit score in a negative way. As a now single mother, I simply can not afford to pay for the gross financial irresponsibility of my ex-husband.

28-12-2018,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"In XXXX I purchased a condo and the original creditor was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I took out two mortgages for the condo at 80 % on first and 20 % on second. XXXX XXXX was an operating sub of XXXX and both were taken over by Bank of America in XXXX. 

In XXXX I was contacted by Bank of America via mail that I was eligible for loan modifications under the HAMP program. I contacted the using the number on the letter. The agent that I spoke to informed me that I would be eligible but first I needed to quit paying my mortgages. She stated that I needed to contact her in 3 months after non-payment. 

In three months the agent informed me that she would be sending out a modification package in the mail. Upon receiving it I filled it out and she informed me to continue to not pay my mortgages. Several months later in XXXX I received my modification package. The principal on the mortgage was {$110000.00} which was XXXX higher than the original 1st. I asked the agent about the 2nd mortgage and if I would be getting another bill. She replied that as far as she was concerned the 2nd was finished and that I was to ignore any and all bills for the property except the one sent by bank of america. She additionally stated that I would be receiving information in the future settling the 2nd mortgage and that it was going to be extinguished and discharged. She stated that I would be receiving a XXXX for the difference if there was one. 

During the modification process all financial adjustments and payments were reported on bills that were consistent with the XXXX XXXX XXXX statements. Upon completion of the trial period and upon transferring over to bank of america bills for the mortgage I received a statement from XXXX XXXX with regards to the 2nd mortgage that showed that the balance was adjusted to XXXX. It was dated in conjunction to the billing reflected on the first mortgage and the bank of america modification. 

I never received any bill with regard to the 2nd mortgage after the modification was completed. 3-4 years later I received a bill in the mail from a third party company that has been trying to collect. I emphatically deny the legitimacy of this debt. 

At the recorder of deeds it shows that the deed of trust assignment for the first mortgage was transferred to bank of america in XXXX of XXXX yet the 2nd mortgage has remained unchanged since XXXX. 

Upon conducting a title search it is clear that bank of america owns the 2nd mortgage still. I have tried to reach out via phone and email to bank of america only to get canned responses. 

I understand that in the early days of HAMP bank of america was contracting with third party companies to administrate the modifications. I also understand that these companies had poorly trained staff. I speculate that it is quit possible that while the third party organized the information and handed it back to bank of america that it is likely that the documentation was lost or incorrectly filed and that the 2nd mortgage was sold as an unsecured debt to a third party. 

I understand that in XXXX there was a settlement with the department of justice in which bank of america had to correct and amend several decisions that it had made as its practices were in violation of the HAMP program. I would greatly appreciate if Bank of America would take the necessary steps to reply to these issues responsibly so that this can come to a close.

Origin : The E-fraud prevention team from HSBC bank called me on XX/XX/XXXX and wanted me to confirm some recent online activities on my accounts. I missed their phone call initially so I tried to call back that afternoon but the wait time is too long. I finally managed to call them back next morning on XXXX. The representative informed me my accounts was compromised. He went through the unauthorized transactions with me and said only the transaction of {$4000.00} can be recalled immediately and for the rest they will investigate and get back to me in a few days. 

Couple days later I am able to see one transaction ( {$8600.00} ) credited back to my account. I called them for a status on the remaining transactions and they are still working on that. That representative said it would take a maximum of 10 days to get me a final response otherwise will credit full amount back to my accounts. 

On XXXX, I sent a formal letter to HSBC headquarter in XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to notify them that I am a victim of identity theft and never authorize anyone else to use my accounts in any way. This is to protect me in case the bank said I never contact them in written statement about the matter. 

Afterward I called them a couple of times on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to get a status for the remaining transactions, and every time I was told I need to wait few more days to finish their investigation. The last time we spoke on XX/XX/XXXX, they said they need 8-10 more business days to investigate!

Note : Attached is the formal letter I sent to HSBC headquarter using certified mail. The reference number of the case they opened for investigation is : XXXX - XXXX.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,NY,112XX,,Consent provided,Web,27-11-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3084623

Called and asked again. Same thing. No papers. Finally third time she says oh we can't mail forms just the tax form. Meanwhile months have gone by. Getting more behind and won't take any paynents. On my own I finally figure out how to download forms on my cell. Then find out how to fill them in on my cell. Took weeks because print is so small. At no time does this person tell me about refinancing or loan repayment plans only modification.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I did not receive a bill and therefore did not notice until I received a telephone call in reference to collecting a bill. The company told me that I had agreed via email to online billing and should have paid the bill on line. I DID NOT agree to online billing, as it has caused me problems with two other companies in the past.

I told the company that if they would mail me a bill, i would pay for all items I had bought, but would not pay late fees or interest because I believe they fraudulently switched me to online billing. I then cancelled the credit card. 
I have since paid for all items bought, but have received two paper bills demanding late fees and interest, which i refuse to pay. 
The last two mornings, I have received two telephone messages demanding that I call them about this account.
