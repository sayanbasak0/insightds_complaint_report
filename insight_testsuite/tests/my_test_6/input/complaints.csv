18-02-2019,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Confusing or missing disclosures,,"I've used PayPal Credit over the past couple of years to make purchases on XXXX based on offers of no interest credit I was offered on multiple purchases. I've borrowed and paid back several thousand dollars. This past XXXX I was offered a "" 24 month with no interest and equal monthly payments '' promotion provided I spent over {$600.00} which I took advantage of. I made purchases totaling {$2200.00} and was told I would have 24 equal payments of {$92.00}. Subsequent to that purchase I also agreed to use PayPal Credit to purchase items using their "" 6 months with no interest if paid in full '' which, about the same time I made the 24 month purchase, they started saying there would be a "" minimum payment '' with these 6 month promotions. Previously, those promotions would be "" 6 months no interest and no payments '' if paid in full - which I always have done. While I wasn't sure how they would calculate the minimum payments on the 6 month items I assumed whatever payments I would make would apply to the balances of those items and reduce the amount I needed to pay them off during the sixth month time period. After I got notice of the first month with a minimum payment that exceeded the {$92.00} on the 24 month promotion I made a payment in excess of that minimum simply so I could calculate how they allocated the different amounts - meaning, how much would go to each purchase as there were multiple purchases on the 6 month promotions. I was stunned to see that they applied nearly the entire amount of the payment - {$450.00} - to the 24 month items. I first emailed them and got a "" canned '' response stating that the payment would be applied to the 24 month item and if I wanted to "" re-allocate '' the payment, I could do so after the next statement billing cycle. While I thought that strange ( and, when I looked back, not all of the {$450.00} payment was applied to the 24 month items, but instead about {$390.00}. I was never able to figure out, looking at the statement, how they planned to allocate the payment ) I then called and had the payment re-allocated with the intention the minimum on the 24 month items would be paid first and the rest would go toward the first items due, which was in early XXXX. This happened the next month as well and I ended up calling and having the payment re-allocated ( I thought ) with the first part of the payment being the {$92.00} on the 24 month promotion. Looking back on the statements, I'm still very confused as to how they're allocating the payments ( and, I get a different explanation each time I call ) - but, at that time, when I called I made an additional payment while I had the representative on the phone. He told me simply to call in each month and they could allocate the money exactly as I wished - with any payment over the {$92.00} being allocated to the 6 month items as I requested. This month, on XX/XX/XXXX I had a minimum payment of {$260.00} due, so I called in and made a payment of {$1000.00} which would make the minimum payment on the 24 month promotion ( the {$92.00} ) plus pay off all of what was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I was assured by the representative that would be what happened. When I checked back a couple days later almost the entire payment amount had been applied to the 24 month promotion. So, I started a chain of "" messages '' ( emails? ) via PayPal 's website requesting they allocate the payment as I had requested. After three or four messages the allocation was changed to the entire "" minimum payment '' - including whatever was required because of the purchases using the 6 month promotions - being applied to the 24 month promotion and then the rest going to the XXXX items - leaving a balance of a bit over {$160.00} on the XXXX items. I then called in an attempt to get all the money I had intended go to the XXXX items applied as I had agreed with the PayPal representative who I originally scheduled the payment with over the phone. After feeling as if the person I was talking to didn't understand what my intentions were I requested to talk to a manager who then told me their rules require them to apply ALL of the "" minimum payment '' to the items with recurring monthly payments - the items I AGREED to terms which said I would have 24 EQUAL monthly payments of {$92.00}. The manager stated that until I had paid off the 24 month promotion this is how the initial part of any payment would be allocated - therefore, essentially, changing the terms of the agreement. Obviously, PayPal feels the FACT they offered me a promotion which called for the 24 months of EQUAL payments of {$92.00} was not anything resembling a contract or firm agreement. By my calculations, depending on how long it takes me to pay off the items I purchased using their 6 month promotion ( the last ones are due to paid off by XX/XX/XXXX ) I might have paid an additional ( almost ) {$1000.00} over the agreed amount of the payments on the 24 month promotion. Additionally, after going through this with the manager I looked more closely at how PayPal has been allocating the payments thus far, and it's hard to understand what they're doing. I don't believe they are allocating the payments in any way according to what I've been told or even according to what the manager explained to me. I do believe my total amount owed is correct, but their statements are not clear as to how these payments are being distributed. Additionally, I find NOTHING on the statement which would tell me how they were going to allocate the payments - meaning their decision to apply ALL of the minimum to the 24 month promotions seems arbitrary and certainly was nothing I agreed to or would have agreed to. I've made the purchases and I will pay off all these items, but I really object to them forcing me to pay the additional money each month in order to be able to pay off the items I purchased on the six month deals. I believe it is an attempt to make it more likely I will end up paying interest on some of the items because, as I said, I'm going to have to come up with close to {$1000.00} more than budgeted to be able to pay off the six month items on time. And, then, I have no idea how PayPal plans to deal with what's left of the 24 month promotion payments, because, obviously, I will have paid much more than the agreed upon {$92.00} per month. This last month the excess I ended up paying over the {$92.00} was {$160.00}. I would say, I find this practice dishonest at best and likely fraudulent. Obviously, with PayPal 24 equal monthly payments isn't really that. The interest for anyone who doesn't pay off the items in the 6 months is close to 30 % and, I find it offensive that it appears PayPal is attempting to create situations where people are more likely going to end up paying this interest. Finally, after looking more closely at the statements, I find PayPal 's entire system confusing and, very possibly, arbitrary.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,WA,,Older American,Consent provided,Web,18-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3155814

Since Firstmark Services has received our loan, we have had nothing but trouble. They tried to make us make a payment prior to the end of the 6 month grace period, they provided incorrect information to both me and my husband on separate calls. Furthermore, after my husband made a payment by phone in the amount required by the caller, I received collection calls stating that we still had a past due balance. After multiple requests for a break down of the payments, I still have not received such information. Now again, after making a payment, we logged into our account saying we have a past due balance. 

We enrolled in interest only payments in XXXX, but have consistently received statements requiring principal and interest payments. Based on our XXXX statement, interest only payments should be around {$170.00} ( give or take a dollar or so ), but the current amount due shows {$280.00}.

Looking at the XXXX reviews, I can see this is common practice with this company. I feel as though they are taking advantage of their customers.

My mother has always been responsible for mortgage payments for that home because that is where she resides. I purchased my own home in XXXX. My mother experienced financial hardship and, unbeknownst to me, stopped paying her mortgage for over 2 years. I was notified in XXXX by Wells Fargo Bank ( who currently services my home loan ) about this situation and was extremely upset. Wells Fargo employees instructed me that my mother was attempting to modify her home loan and needed my signature on the modification paperwork to do so. I informed Wells Fargo employees that I WOULD NOT consent to signing a modification and advised them that my mother needed to refinance her property in order to remove me from her home loan. Wells Fargo employees instructed me to sign a Quit Claim Deed and advised me that I would be removed from the deed of my mother 's home and the loan ( deed of trust ) for my mother 's residence ( above referenced property ). I signed a Quit Claim Deed in XXXX. I learned in XX/XX/XXXX that Wells Fargo actually modified my mother 's original loan without my knowledge, consent, or signature in XXXX. I was not aware of any of this until XX/XX/XXXX and have never received any documentation pertaining to the loan on my mother 's residence. I have been a homeowner since XXXX and have not lived at my mother 's residence since about XXXX. After repeatedly questioning them, I learned that Wells Fargo employees instructed me to sign a Quit Claim Deed in XXXX because that actually ONLY removed me from the deed and NOT the deed of trust. Since I adamantly REFUSED to sign a loan modification in reference to the property listed above in XXXX, Wells Fargo employees used deceitful tactics to have me removed from the deed of the property. Wells Fargo then processed a loan modification without my knowledge in XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo employees acted as if they had a document with my signature on it from XXXX. I informed them several times that my signature was forged if they have any modification document from XXXX containing my signature. I later learned that they DID NOT have modification paperwork from XXXX containing my signature. I was informed in XX/XX/XXXX by Wells Fargo employees that "" they were not required to have my signature on the loan modification in XXXX. '' I repeatedly advised that this was illegal. I was informed that this practice was "" ok '' back in XXXX but advised that this practice "" has since changed '' and that they require signatures from everyone listed on the loan.

21-01-2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband I purchased six XXXX  champagne glasses from a vendor, XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, XXXX for the exchange rate price of {$1000.00}. The purchase was based on a model product in the vendor 's showroom, with the final product shipped to us. 
The glasses arrived via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Immediately upon inspecting the product, we found that the quality was defective and the items were not in fact the same as the glasses we viewed in XXXX, and upon which we made the purchase ( different shape, different materials ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the merchant noting that the product was not what we ordered, requesting that they provide the product as represented or a refund. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant responded that the glasses are first quality items, refusing to offer any resolution. We responded again on XX/XX/XXXX, again requesting that the merchant make it right. The merchant did not respond. We reached out to the merchant again on XX/XX/XXXX, noting that the matter would be taken up with our credit card company. No response. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a dispute to Chase for "" item not as described/defective. '' In their response to Chase, the merchant stated that we "" personally selected the six glasses. '' This is not true. As per the original response to us from the merchant, the glasses were made after the fact ; they are not glasses that we selected. The communication I had with Chase was regarding the merchant 's misrepresentation that we purchased the glasses in person. At no time was I ever advised to return the glasses. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase notifying me that my dispute was denied because I "" did not return the merchandise, '' this despite the fact that I was advised by Chase during one of our conversations that we were not required to return the merchandise. I called Chase who advised me to resubmit documents to reopen the dispute. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a request for the dispute to be reopened. On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase once again closed the dispute without speaking to me, again stating that I failed to return the merchandise. This letter was not sent to me directly via mail, despite the fact that I faxed and mailed my dispute letter. Instead it was added to my account notices, which I did not receive until XXXX when I went searching for resolution, having never heard back from Chase. I discovered that without speaking to me, Chase reopened and closed my second dispute in less than 5 business days, without making any efforts to contact me. 
I called Chase again on XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised initially that the dispute was closed. I asked to speak to a supervisor, XXXX. He first advised me that I could have no recourse since it had been "" so long since the original transaction. '' I informed XXXX that this transaction had been in dispute since XXXX so I did not understand why further action would be time barred. He then came back and told me a number of contradictory things. He stated that Visa denied my dispute because they had no evidence that I returned the merchandise. He then stated that returning the merchandise would not make a difference since the contract states that there are no refunds. He then said that I needed to show continuous efforts to resolve the matter with the merchant, even though the merchant had never communicated again with us. I was informed that I was required to make the right efforts to resolve the matter with the merchant now that Chase had denied my dispute. He could not tell me what would constitute right. He repeatedly advised, however that I actually had no recourse so I need not waste my time. I asked if I should return the merchandise and was told he could not or would not advise me to return the merchandise, despite this being the stated reason for denial of my dispute. I was told I should again reach out to the merchant and ask them to accept a return of the merchandise and then I can resubmit to reopen the dispute. I asked why I would be required to continue making futile efforts to communicate with the merchant, when the matter was being disputed by Chase and the merchant had not responded to my repeated inquiries. I also asked what was the point of me resubmitting the dispute if Chase would not bother communicating further with me. 
The experience with Chase has been frustrating and unhelpful. They have not communicated effectively with us and have provided contradictory information. They have also failed to specify exactly what it is we as the victimized consumer should to retain these funds. As noted to the Chase agent, we have done everything asked but they have been unhelpful and have failed to advocate on our behalf. Chases actions have sought to obfuscate this matter and discourage us from pursuing our rightful recourse. I was advised several times during my phone call with XXXX that I should abandon my efforts, which was disappointing and made me feel further victimized.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,782XX,,Consent provided,Web,21-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3129906

My 3rd check is going out today XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX before I sent the letter asking if I could get a statement showing the correct balance and her was basically no. Since I refused to set-up payments she could not send one. That is incorrect. I did n't refuse to set-up payments, I just told her that I could n't due the {$200.00} something. Each time I send payment to iQuantified Management Services, I copy the old statement she sent me and cross out the date and the amount to place the correct amoutn and date I am sending my payment in. <P/>I received a letter from XXXX XXXX and amount shows {$750.00} that I still owe and in capital letters tells me that if the account is not paid in full by XXXX XXXX XXXXey exercise their right to refer my account to an attorney and report as paid credit. <P/>For {$550.00}, go ahead and report, I will dispute. And my account will be paid in full by the time they get a lawyer here in AZ. All I have been asking for from XXXX is a statement showing my remaining balance and she advised no, since I did not set up payment arrangements. <P/>Now they have been cashing my cashier checks and I do not get a statement??

I filed a dispute with my Chase XXXX Visa. Chase gave a temp credit of {$680.00}. 
The merchant responded to the charge back and provided Chase Visa a XXXX tracking number. 
I fought with Chase because I knew we didn't receive the teeth, and yet I had no idea how to prove we hadn't received the teeth. 
I left chase alone & paid the {$680.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX my neighbor had a plumbing emergency and had a plumbing company over. One  of the workers had found a package on the front porch which had my address on it saw me outside in the driveway ( we share a driveway ) and gave me the package. 
Turns out the XXXX delivered to the wrong address ( which has happened before in my rural area ). I have went put of my way to make 2 deliveries of packages to houses on my street. 
When my bf opened the package they were not what we ordered at all. So I contacted my Chase XXXX Visa explained to them the complete situation and apologized for giving them a hard time previously, told them we got the merchandise but it wasnt at all what we ordered and they told me to send it back to XXXX ask for a refund and wait 12 to 15 days for the merchant to give us a refund, if after the 12 days had passed they would process a refund for my {$680.00} once I called them back and provide a XXXX number for our return. So we did that. Never got a refund or response from the merchant and Chase XXXX visa hadn't been responding to my redispute and I had not seen a credit back to my card. So I kept in contact with chase customer service and on 3 different occasions from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX was assured that I would be getting a refund from multiple customer service reps. XXXX I called into chase and had my issue escalated ended up speaking with a lady named XXXX, she advised me that anytime I sent a secured message to them regarding anything to do with this merchant or merchandise or initial dispute a rep would go in the message center and just delete without responding stated that XX/XX/XXXX I was advised in writing that no future further action regarding this dispute would EVER happen. So I asked XXXX why all of the other reps never told me this, why they advised me to send back the merchandise and chase would process a refund? XXXX just said she was very sorry I was not aware of the XX/XX/XXXX letter and there was nothing further She was able to do for me. I asked if I could speak to someone above her and turns out She Is her own supervisor and must own JP Morgan Chase bank she told me there was noone else that I could verbally speak with I could write a letter to the executive office but there wasn't a number. 
I found the number. 
I contact the executive branch. They take my complaint. I'm assigned a man named XXXX. He advises me he would be back in touch with me within a couple of business days. The executive office told me it's their job to figure out if there was any wrong doing in the disputes department throughout my case, and then they make things right. I hadn't heard back from XXXX. I follow up on XX/XX/XXXX no response I call again XX/XX/XXXX and he finally calls me back stats that he only could find a few calls and absolutely no secure messages through their mesg center. I advised him he needed to recheck letting him know I have screen shots of the secured messages and also some recordings of phone calls he states he can not find. He asks to have a couple of hours and call me back with his new research findings. XXXX calls me back and has found some calls and listened to the recordings and admits that I was correct, however, they are not willing to reimburse me for my {$680.00}. He's not willing to take responsibility for Chase customer service reps advising me to send the merchandise back and get a refund, In the phone calls he did review he didn't find THAT call, there isn't anything in writing from me thru their secure message center and they can't find the phone calls I'm referring to regarding their employees telling me what to do and stating I'm not responsible for a product that I havent used and have returned and or that's incorrect. XXXX denies some phone calls he still can't find so I let him know I'm going to my cell provider and get a print out fron XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX to show me contacting them and the duration of those calls. XXXX had already told me Chase did not place any notes into my account and doesn't have to input due dilligence. After XXXX admitted he found that there in fact was misconduct on their part, he told me he found opportunities for coaching with 2 or 3 employees. States hes not willing to take responsibility for Chase customer service reps advising me to send the merchandise back and get a refund, in the phone calls he did review he didn't find THAT call, there isn't anything in writing from me thru their secure message center and he wasn't able to find the phone calls I'm referring to regarding their employees telling me what to do and stating I'm not responsible for a product that I havent used and have returned and or that's incorrect! He found coaching opportunities! That doesn't put my {$680.00} back into my account! And surely doesn't make things right! I have screen shots of the secure messages that I sent with acknowledgement from chase they received my messages. This blows my mind!

20-02-2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX AM, I spoke to XXXX ( Account Supervisor of Chase ) who confirmed that my account is being double charged on the interest for a promotion interest balance because my monthly payments are NOT being applied to the monthly interest. Instead the monthly interest is being added to the principal amount so that the principal increases monthly thereby increasing the accrued interest. Consequently, Chase is charging interest on interest every month by increasing the principal when monthly payments more than cover the interest and minimum payment due. 
XXXX informed me that although this is unfair to me, Chase does this per federal law without stating which federal law or offering to provide a copy of the federal law. He further refused to elevate this matter to his supervisor or provide an address for me to submit a written complaint. 
This is wrong. When monthly payments more than cover the minimum payment and interest payments, Chase can not be increasing the principal amount by adding monthly interest amounts to the principal balance to impose higher interest obligations on the consumer. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, the interest on the promotion interest balance has increased due to Chases practice of increasing the principal balance by adding the monthly interest to the principal and NOT applying the monthly payment to the monthly interest charged. 
I do not believe Congress intended for Chase to legally charge interest on top of interest by allowing Chase to increase a principal balance by not applying consumers payments to the interest charged every month",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,VA,221XX,,Consent provided,Web,20-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3157691

I made every payment ; occasionally a week or 2 late. However, payments were always made. I had a payment not clear because they cashed the check before the payment was due and the check was dated for, however they continued to cash my checks afterwards. XX/XX/XXXX, a repo man showed up at my job to take possession of my car. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because I could see on my bank account that they had received my payment. they advised they were not going to cash the check and wanted cash for the current payment, the next month 's as well as the fee for the repossession. As I was in XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX is in XXXX, the time difference didn't allow for me to get to the bank for the cash as it was already past XXXX est. I had no choice but to let the repossession to happen. On my credit report they show my account current until after XX/XX/XXXX at which point I no longer had the vehicle. I received notification they were outing the car up for auction, however I never received any paperwork after the sale of the car. They charged off {$9500.00} for what I can only assume is the amount they sold the vehicle for. I initially financed {$12000.00}, making 7 months of payments of $ XXXX. I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX on multiple occasions to request proof of sale at the auction. they have refused to provide me the requested information or allow me to speak to the person who can provide me the information. 

If the initial loan was {$12000.00} and they sold the vehicle for {$9500.00} at the very least my balance should be {$3200.00} ; however the payments I've made should be factored in the balance as well. 

I've attached the credit report ; item 1 is the account information that you apparently could not find previously.

I reached someone today who told me my voicemails may not of been responded to, because I didn't include enough information in the voicemail beyond my phone number. While the agent ( who was actually a manager ), did not seem very apologetic, she informed me that this missing information is why I was not called back, however it does not say in the voicemail what needs to be left. I asked about a settlement offer and was given an amount and percentage, which worked out to be {$760.00}. I was told I would only have 90 days to pay it, which is not enough given my current financial situation. I asked about paying the balance to have the account deleted and was told this was against "" fair credit reporting laws ''. The FCRA does not prohibit deletion as I'm sure the CFPB already knows.

After no response or verification from either the creditors nor the bureaus, I sent more notarized certified letters out dated XX/XX/2019. Again, I did not get any verification of ANY signed consumer contract as stated in Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Report Act.

On XX/XX/2019, AGAIN,, I sent a final round of letters as a final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding refusal to delete UNVERIFIED information from my consumer file. AGAIN NO RESPONSE!!! 

The unverified accounts on my record have damaged my good name by not allowing me to obtain credit. I know for a fact that all of these letters were delivered and read by all parties they were sent to, and still i had not received any consumer signed contract as verification as stated BY LAW these entities MUST PROVIDE ME. 

I'm past any resolution on this matter and demand that ALL INFORMATION be deleted that was not verified, including all hard inquiries.

I had been dealing with several issues of identity theft, related to my ex-husband 's theft of my credit cards and personal information. The bills for this card were not going to my address as a result of this. When I was alerted to the debt, I attempted to get the debt consolidated with XXXX XXXX XXXX, an organization I had been working with to pay off the debts accrued by my ex husband, in an effort to repair my credit. XXXX XXXX made it very difficult to consolidate under this program, even though I was able to do this easily with my bank, which had recommended the program as a legitimate non-profit debt consolidation ( not forgiveness ) program. 

I spoke to an XXXX representative and explained the situation to the individual on the phone, stating that I would pay off the debt in full, but that I wanted adverse information about the debt off my credit report, as I had not acquired the debt, nor had I received any indication the debt had been accrued, since the bills were not sent to my address. 

I agreed to a lump sum payoff under the understanding that this adverse information would be removed from my credit report. The cost was substantial to me, around {$10000.00}, but it was worth the price of fixing my credit and moving on from the debts accrued in my name. I was under the impression the individual I spoke with on the phone agreed to these terms. However, several months later, the adverse information is still on my credit report and, in fact, until last month, XXXX XXXX was still reflecting that I had not paid the debt, though I had done so more than a year earlier. 

I am very distressed by this situation, as the identity theft has severely impacted my credit score and made it nearly impossible to move on from my divorce and find a new home for myself and my children. I would like this issue resolved, and for further advice on how to remove other negative items on my report that have been the result of identity theft.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NJ,070XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05-07-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3297075

Documentation as to whether or not I received intravenous contrast dye was poor. Middle record records indicate I received the contrast dye after the procedure was completed. The radiology company administering the test identified an error in their medical record system that they have not corrected. Thus they can not prove objectively that contrast was administered except to look at the radiology films which they have not provided me in a readable format. Despite the radiology company having my correct address and telephone number, I never received any bills at my residence for this service. They then sent the bill to the respondent for debt collection. Despite having the correct address and telephone number for my residence from the radiology company and having access to my credit report, the debt collector made no verifiable attempt to give me a call by telephone or send me a letter. They claim that they sent me a letter via regular mail but they can not prove its being sent or being received. Despite having my correct address and telephone number and access to my credit file, The debt collector continue to call an unrelated individual with the same last name. After not receiving a satisfactory response or payment, they placed the adverse account to my credit report. This caused me to lose a high security job offer worth {$180000.00} in salary annually. 

If the bill is in the road, I would like to pay it. However I expect to be compensated for my damages as a result of the deck collector not providing me with the opportunity to dispute the debt in a timely fashion or providing me with any notice that a debt actually was owed.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Eastern Account Systems of Connecticut, Inc.",NJ,080XX,,Consent provided,Web,09-07-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3300683

We have worked long and hard to build an exemplary credit history and had a strong credit score of XXXX. We had no late payments and no negative reports. As part of my husbands preparation for treatment, knowing that he wouldnt be able to manage our finances regularly, he set up automatic payments on our {$4500.00} XXXX credit card debt, amounting to {$150.00} per month ( above the minimum ), to continue until he was able to return to health and make further arrangements. 

Unfortunately, without our knowledge, interest on our debt increased and our pre-arranged payments no longer covered our monthly obligation. Thirty- and Sixty days late charges began to accumulate, and as a result, our credit score dropped to XXXX. XXXX XXXX recorded our dropping score, but didnt reflect any issues with XXXX. The cause of the decline was, at first, a mystery. 

As soon as we learned about this situation, just over two weeks ago, we called XXXX to resolve the issue and make arrangements to pay off the balance. We were told the debt was out of their hands and had been sent to collections. 

We spoke to our local branch manager, Mrs. XXXX XXXX, who understood our situation and attempted to solve the problem. She explained our predicament to a relevant supervisor, only to face the same response : We cant do anything. 

Though we can provide proof that we never missed a payment, our credit remains severely damaged. Again, our credit shows no late payments. In fact, our credit report shows no late payments from any of 15 other creditors. Only an insane person would pay everybody else and disregard one creditor. After working years to establish perfect credit, our compromised credit score means we can not refinance our home or pursue our life plans. The direct impact on our lives, however, is far more fundamental. 

Our efforts toward establishing perfect credit are part of our dream to establish a family. I have recently found out that I cant have children of my own. We have been working with the XXXX XXXX adoption agency in XXXX XXXX to adopt a child, that is my life long dream. I was born in XXXX as my father was U.S. Military and my mother XXXX.

Navient became the my creditor. First off they said I received a $ XXXXXXXX refund after the consolidation, which I never received or even heard about. 

When I originally had my loans consolidated by the XXXX XXXX XXXX they were $ XXXXXXXX ( approx. ) When I began making payments to Navient, my loans were suddenly over {$80000.00} ( approx ). I have been paying on these loans since XX/XX/XXXX monthly and they haven't decreased at all. 

I called Navient to find out how I could address my student loan debt as my principle amount continued to increase despite payments recommended by Navient. I asked about loan forgiveness because I worked for a non-profit drug and alcohol treatment program as a counselor for many years. I was told that Navient did not offer loan forgiveness. I asked the young woman if there was someone else I could speak to about my options and she told me she was the supervisor and she wished she could help me, she understood my frustration because she had student loans herself she had to pay back. There was nothing they could do for me. I said how can my loans be increasing if I am paying the interest plus principle ( approx $ XXXX. ). She said she didn't know. 

Several months later I called again as I had resigned from my position and was on unemployment. Navient instructed me to get a forbearance on my loans. I did so until I was off unemployment and employed again. They suggested I 2xs that I do an interest only re-payment plan. 


I believe Navient manipulated my ignorance and did not guide me well with repayment options. I believed that Navient misguided me into a forbearance as well as an interest only payment to profit from my ignorance. I further believe that Navient either recorded a refund that they never sent me or that this refund as a result of my loan consolidation was fabricated for their benefit. Finally I believe that Navient hires debt counselors that are not qualified to advise students about their debts to Navient. Taking advantage of students for profit is wrong.

Then these same debt buyers that used to be known as collection agencies could re-assign the debt to a fourth party for collection enforcement. This process of stating that debts are being purchased by a third party and then enforced by a fourth party is the larges scam in America. The U. S. Supreme Court decision in XX/XX/2017 known as XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is responsible for this scam. This decision basically states that since a third party purchases the debt, that my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is VOID. The problem is that almost all unsecured debts are sold off to XXXX XXXX in various traunces in securitized trusts. There simply is no resolution where the debt can be purchased, only that the debt can be assigned for collection purposes. Each financial institution must file a 10Q filing quarterly with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The rules on debts being charged off is with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through the FDIC Act, Code 5000. A debt can be classified either standard or sub-standard. Debts over 180 days late must go into the sub-standard category and written off on a quarterly 10Q SEC filing. These charge 0ffs usually are submitted in the tens of millions of dollars. So its virtually for these debts to be sold..period. Accordingly, I request full validation proving the debt purchase. Secondly, I will entertain a very low settlement agreement to put my dispute to rest. All of the settlements can be submitted through the CFPB portal email address submitted. I am still within my rights under the FDCPA since proof of a purchase to a third party has never been established.",,Alliance Data Card Services,CA,922XX,,Consent provided,Web,19-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3155800

I was at XXXX and had the loan specialist speak to Westlake representative ( rep ) and was told the payoff quote amount is $ XXXX.After being approved for the auto refinanced loan at XXXX, Westlake was again contacted to confirm exact mailing address for the payoff check to be mailed. Westlake/Rep stated to be sure to add the per diem expense for the days in the mail to the payoff amount or the check will be insufficient funds. A cashier check dated XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$7200.00} was sent to Westlake for my auto loan payoff.

I applied and went through weeks of endless phone calls, submissions of various documents, which they kept requesting after each submission and NEVER, EVER requested the first time.

The refinance interest would be 13 %, high, but not as insane as 22.75, but they said the amount I wanted to borrow was too high relative to my earnings, while they gave me a lot more with the income a lot less within 10 minutes back in XX/XX/2018. 

They want me locked into 5 years of the financial slavery where I would be paying more than {$15000.00} in interest instead of 3 yrs 1/3 of the previous amount in interest.

With the refinance I would be paying a basically similar monthly amount, which I was paying until today, and they had absolutely NO problems with me making these payments. They had NO problem whatsoever loaning me much higher amount the first time.

26-11-2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"On XX/XX/2018, my intent was to pay off my mortgage with PHH Mortgage. I could not wire funds as my bank was in New York State and I was told I had to come into the office in NY and I am in Florida. I decided to do an e-check for the principal balance, and a follow-up e-check for the remaining daily interest and {$10.00} recording fee. Both payments were put into a suspense account by PHH on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively. They told me they needed 10 business days because the funds were not certified. Payoff figures were for XX/XX/18. I was told by TWO customer service reps that my property taxes ( due XX/XX/XXXX to avoid paying additional tax ) would NOT be paid because of the payoff intent, and that the escrow was frozen. I didn't think this was appropriate as they were not going to post my payments until close to when the tax bill was due ( with discounts ). I waited until XX/XX/XXXX, and processed an e-check for {$7.00}, xxx.xx from my bank to XXXX County Tax Collector in Florida. Today, PHH states that they sent a bulk check on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX County for the same amount to pay my taxes. PHH says if they were to request the funds back, it would take FOUR MONTHS for me to get my monies back. ( I still have about {$1900.00} left in escrow as well, which they tell me would take about 3 weeks to receive the refund ). I then called XXXX County, and they said they have not yet processed the bulk payment, and would probably do so either XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. Even though I told them I already paid, and that my mortgage will be paid off today ( they are to apply the suspense payments today to full pay the account ), they refuse to send me the overpayment, and state that it must go back to the payer ( PHH ). XXXX County says it could take 4-6 weeks for the monies to be sent back to PHH. I don't think I should have to wait four months for my money.

I followed all their guidelines and steps involving the short sale process and had the auction of my home delayed in order to ensure that i would be able to complete a short sale and get my life back on track. With the help of my realtor we got a buyer to put an offer in which we submitted to them. Around the end of XX/XX/XXXX they agreed to review my short sale and sent out an appraiser to get the value of the house. Their value came back higher than our buyers offer of XXXX. Despite their lower value, they told us they were looking to get XXXX. We immediately went back on the market to look for that value. We were able to get the original buyer to come up to meet their counter, and when we did they refused to review it as they had set an auction date and claimed we did not have enough time to submit it for a review. They claimed they had issues getting into the property a second time which caused some delays in them getting another value, but we never received a call from any appraiser. They finally sent someone on XX/XX/XXXX and my realtor had to meet them out there to make sure they would get in. At this point another auction date was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX so we were still on a time crunch. They got their value back at the same as it was previously XX/XX/XXXX and asked us to wait til after the holidays for an approval. After the holidays we were told that they were looking to NET XXXX even though their valuation of the property came back at XXXX and said their investor would no longer look at a short sale. I have put a lot of effort into this short sale only for it to be shut down because SLS 's negligence and inability to follow through with the process. Their inconsistency leads me to believe that they never actually entertained our offer, and put us through this process for no reason.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Specialized Loan Servicing Holdings LLC,MA,,,Consent provided,Web,15-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3125727

However, on about XX/XX/2018, I hired The XXXX XXXX to challenge the items found within my credit file. The XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that when Equifax deleted The XXXX/XXXX  account from my credit file, they failed to also delete the negative history associated with XXXX/XXXX  account from my credit file. Today XX/XX/2018, I spoke again with Equifax. I explained the issue Equifax. 

The representative at Equifax stated they did not receive the dispute regarding XXXX/XXXX until Saturday XX/XX/2018. Based on their response, I contacted The XXXX XXXX XXXX again. I presented the response I got from Equifax. The XXXX XXXX XXXX has indicated that they electronically submitted the dispute on XX/XX/2018. That means Equifax has had this dispute for more than a few weeks now. XXXX XXXX stated that Equifax would have received the dispute almost instantaneously on XX/XX/2018. Prior to ending the call with Equifax, The representative further indicated, they must send this information to XXXX and start the process over again. There are a few issues here. 

Equifax should have cleared the deletion of the negative history when they deleted the item. Today, an Equifax member provided me with information that conflicts what the XXXX XXXX XXXX has stated. Also, both XXXX  and XXXX  where both able to resolve get everything done correctly the first time, so Why didn't Equifax? I'm in the process trying to purchase a home.
