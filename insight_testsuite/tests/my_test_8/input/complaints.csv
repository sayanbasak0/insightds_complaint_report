In XX/XX/XXXX I took a permanent job with the XXXX of the XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

In XXXX XXXX I consolidated my federal loans, entered into a income-based repayment plan, and enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. 

I have stayed permanently employed with the XXXX of the XXXX ever since and am still employed at XXXX. 

Every year I submit my employer certification, my taxes, and my income-based repayment plan recalculation. 

I have taken 15 months of deferments since XXXX. That means I have made 89 payments ( of my 120 payments ) since enrolling in the PSLF program. 

My loan has been sold a couple of times and FedLoan Servicing took it over in about XX/XX/XXXX. FedLoan Servicing now says that I have only made 68 qualifying payments and they do not have a record of payments made prior to XX/XX/XXXX. They are conducting an audit but told me they could not say when it would be completed and it may take 6 months or longer. My bank says that the only way they can pull bank statements that far back is if I pay a fee of {$35.00} per hour of research and {$5.00} per bank statement and that the research may be extensive because the records are on microfiche. 

I believe that FedLoan Servicing is not counting the qualifying payments I made between XXXX and XXXX and are shorting me by about 21 payments ( over {$10000.00} ) and that this will incorrectly extend my PSLF repayment period and may interfere with the ultimate forgiveness of my loans.

However, when we contacted them after the six months, we were advised that the total amount due was the six months and our regular payment. We are extremely frustrated with their process and representatives and afraid that we will lose our home through foreclosure. Also, they apparently approved us for a repayment plan and it was supposed to be mailed to us, however, we only received a request for mortgage assistance package in the mail.

10-02-2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am in the PSLF program with XXXX and I requested that Navient revisit my loan payment of XX/XX/2012 as they report it as short. Sallie Mae took over my Direct Loans without my approval inXX/XX/2012. In XX/XX/2012 I received a bill for {$1200.00} that did not reflect my Income Based payment plan that I was on with Direct Loans. I called to have my bill recalculated based upon my income and I was eventually told my new payment would be {$390.00}. The representative also stated my first payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX so I made my payment early on XX/XX/XXXX. The following month I received a bill for {$410.00} and paid it in full. The next month it dropped to {$400.00}. I have found out through XXXX that this payment does not count toward my 120 payments because the payment was not for the full amount. 
I can only assume the customer service representative only saw the payment for loan # XXXX and did not include Loan # XXXX. At the time I was not aware they were separate loans. I paid the amount she instructed me to. As you can verify from my payment history I have always made my loan payments in full and on time. I made my payment in good faith for the amount I was told was due. Obviously if the representative would have told me to pay an additional {$12.00} I would have done it. Unfortunately they did not provide a written statement reflecting the new amount due so I made my payment based upon their employees verbal statement of the amount due. I have submitted documents proving my case. Document 1 shows the original payment due of {$1200.00}. XXXX that did not reflect my correct IBR plan. Doc 2 clearly shows my payment of {$390.00}, no amount past due, and a XXXX payment due of {$390.00}. ( apparently this was an additional statement error that was then changed to {$410.00} ). Again I made my payment on time for the amount I was told. I should not be responsible for their billing errors. As I researched Navient online it appears this is a common practice.

I contacted Navient ( since they took over from Sallie Mae ) to try to get this issue corrected. They did not credit the payment as requested and I have included their summary as the last document. The bottom line is that I paid the amount that was requested by their agent, I paid it 2 weeks early, and when they billed me an additional amount ( above the statement amount ) the following month I paid that in full as well. Clearly I met my obligation for that to be a qualifying payment.I should not be punished for their employee 's mistake. As I am nearing the end of my PSLF program I am trying to ensure I have credit for all of my payments. With the uncertainty surrounding the program itself, every payment is crucial before the program ends so I really would appreciate your assistance in resolving this as soon as possible. I can be reached at ( XXXX ) XXXX or via email at XXXX.

Before I do any bill pay, I MAKE SURE that I have enough money from my checking account to cover the amount of check I am writing.

As soon as I have issued a bill pay check from my check account, PenFed EITHER closes my checking account OR transfers the money back from my checking account to my savings account WITHOUT MY CONSENT AND KNOWLEDGE!

This has happened TWICE already, and they are doing this to force me to close my accounts with them, not to mention contributing to my unnecessary stress and greatly affecting my state of mind.

Thus, PenFed is committing fraud on my behalf by intentionally and knowingly making it look like I am bouncing checks when I AM NOT, not to mention cruelly and consistently harassing me.

They are also prolonging transactions on purpose so that they can control how long I keep my accounts open instead of me doing that!

There was also a time that one of the member representatives told us ( family member and I ) over the phone that we would have to go back to Texas to deal with this account in a satisfactory manner.

No travel to where the account was opened, no satisfactory resolution was what this PenFed employee indicated.

This was news to me, as the last time I had seen that bill 's balance it was submitted to XXXX for payment under their auto policy claims department, and they hadn't informed me it was paid or not.

The XXXX XXXX representative said she would quote "" do everything she could to have it removed. '' Well, it has not been removed per our discussion, and my disputes about the improper billing procedure have been initiated with Experian. This is why I am writing to complain, because Experian has all the information they need to remove this account. They know that I did not know of its existence until it was observed on my Experian. They know that XXXX XXXX improperly submitted bills to an address that I did not live at. They know that I had an agreement for this account to be removed. They know I have not been late on any payments, EVER, and yet this account remains. I have disputed it multiple times. Each time Experian waits a day and then takes no action, and just marking the dispute as completed without removing the account. It hasn't been properly handled. It should be removed. My theory is that no one at Experian has read or understood the content of my communications, and that no one at XXXX XXXX has bothered to keep our agreement to remove after I held up my end of the bargain and paid in full.

This is especially true as all these small accounts and payments to them where handled by my wife and I don't know those details off the top of my head, and she isn't around.

I contacted Equifax 3x and every time I am told to contact the creditors which I have done to no avail. It is a never ending cycle of being told the same thing over and over again to no avail. It has affected me personally and I intend to pursue litigation and hold Equifax liable as they have offered me no recourse. If the inquiries are a "" matter of fact '' and the companies were doing account reviews they should be coded as "" soft '' not hard inquiries. Under no circumstances are unauthorized "" hard inquiries '' allowed to remain a fact of record. Equifax continues to tell me that and that is not true. I have attached the letter of the unauthorized inquires which has been previously sent to Equifax which they have completely ignored. You are told to contact the creditor over and over again and they know that gets no results. If the inquiries are fraudulent, then of course the companies have documentation because they think you authorized it. That does not mean its authorized. Additionally, several companies indicated they were account reviews. If they were account reviews then they should be coded as such. The companies then lie and say they will contact Equifax to remove it or code it as soft but it never happens. This has been going back and forth far too long. I will absolutely take legal action if Equifax ignores my 4th request to remove or correct inaccurate information. If the creditors have been negligent in correcting this information Equifax has a duty to remove it or correct it. This is becoming a little ridiculous.

I paid off this account on XX/XX/2018 and had a XXXX balance showing on my online account. I did not have any other charges until I called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX to renew my account for {$150.00} and discuss the late payment. I talked to XXXX XXXX who verified that their accounts are reported under XXXX and told me that they had a glitch in their system that was reporting false late payments and I was not the first person to call about it that day. She advised me to send her an email to XXXX with proof of the late payment and she would forward it to tech support to correct the issue. I sent the email but did not receive a response so I called customer service again on XX/XX/2018 and was told to send an email again to XXXX XXXX  XXXX and the issue would be corrected for the next reporting date at the end of the month. When it did update, they only changed the status to pays as agreed but did not remove the late payment or update my balance. I filed a dispute with Equifax on XX/XX/2018 for the late payment and incorrect balance and received the results on XX/XX/2018. According to Equifax, everything was verified on the XXXX and they did not remove the late payment or update the balance to {$72.00}.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33680,,Consent provided,Web,11-11-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3071468

I would like to make the CFPB aware of this occurrence as I never received a formal document from XXXX/XXXX XXXX notifying me of the possibility of a default judgment or documentation demonstrating the suit that was filed in the XXXX Municipal/Circuit Court for period XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX.

I still have not received a call/ voicemail message or an email in response to my request to create a payment arrangement. As I have not been given a file number yet due to no one reaching out to me - I am unable to establish a payment arrangement or initiate a payment.

I do not have vacation/leave available to go to court or additional money available for legal representation and would like to establish and arrangement in order to resolve this issue.

I opened the account with that address, received the check book and debit card with that same address. They never doubt that address is not belonged to me. Now when I ask them to return a check to the same address, they think I am illegal. They doubt I am not myself. The address is on my credit file and the file related to my driver license. All the documents I provided are totally legal and real! 

When I open the account, they never doubt my identity. When they mailed me the materials including the checkbook and debit card, they never doubt my identity.

24-04-2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the XXXX, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the  requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,333XX,,Consent provided,Web,24-04-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3221368

The loan servicer, ( Chase Home Mortgage ), the PMI company ( XXXX XXXX ) and the loan holder ( XXXX XXXX ) are requiring me to get a BPO ( Brokers Price Opinion ) which costs {$100.00} for determination that my house has not decreased in value. 

Per the HPA ( Homeowners Protection Act ), when a homes LTV reaches 78 % of the original mortgage amount the loan servicer has to request the PMI be cancelled. Chase Mortgage will not request the PMI to be cancelled unless a BPO is obtained. I am being penalized by paying extra on my mortgage to get the PMI cancelled earlier than the predicted amoritization date of when my LTV would be 80 % which was predicted to be XX/XX/XXXX. 

Furthermore, if i had not been forward thinking and not checked on this my PMI would have been automatically canceled in XX/XX/XXXX, however my LTV would have most likely been around 70 % at that point. I would not have received a refund on the PMI that was not required to be paid based on I reached a LTV of 78 % in XX/XX/XXXX.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,330XX,,Consent provided,Web,04-07-2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3296165

ADDITIONALLY, TO THAT DEMAND, I REQUEST that you Please provide a copy of my corrected and updated report once you have complied with the law. I request that you VERIFY the VALIDITY of all claims physically, CHECK for the factual and precise CERTIFIED COMPLIANCE OF REPORTING and REMOVE or MODIFY as needed any item ( s ) of derogatory allegation of which the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE VALIDITY and or the CERTIFIABLE COMPLIANT REPORTING is deficient or missing via willful derelict OR even if dereliction is due to ignorance. To collect any claim MUST be verifiably VALID, and to REPORT the alleged VALID COLLECT-ABLE derogatory information MUST be of a documented CERTIFIED COMPLIANT REPORTING, such as to the true, correct, complete, timely, and undeniably factually perfect XXXX XXXX FORMAT reporting compliance standards! VERFIFY PROPERLY BOTH the VALIDITY OF and PERFECT CERTIFIED COMPLIANT REPORTING OF all claim ( s ) and every aspect of claim ( s ) OR ELSE permanently REMOVE THE FOLLOWING DATA/ACCOUNTS and or the undocumented derogatory aspects of such data/accounts : REBUTTAL NOTATION : Accuser has failed to provide any evidence of either the injurious derogatory claim 's verifiable validity NOR any documented certification of compliance as reporting, each mandatory condition to report so DELETE NOW! Item is mine YET is NOT proven COMPLIANT in its reporting. As reported, Item is mine YET is NOT LEGALLY REPORTABLE due to being one or more of untrue, erroneous, incomplete, unverifiable, invalid, or else wise NOT proven COMPLIANT in its reporting. Per My states reporting laws and the applicable federal standards of lawful reporting, ANY REPORTED ALLEGATION of delinquency and or derogatory of injury against a consumer MUST be documented as TRUE, CORRECT, COMPLETE, TIMELY, of accused consumers ownership and responsibility, fully valid, and irrefutably verifiable as such. ADDITIONALLY, even if true and valid, any claim of derogatory and injurious nature MUST BE REPORTED IN FULL COMPLIANCE, even to the mandatory true correct and complete XXXX XXXX FORMAT REPORTING COMPLIANCE and further be testimonial and CERTIFID AS being so or else claim ( s ) must be vacated permanently and immediately! DELETE NOW to be COMPLIANT!

Should this item of alleged account ( or account aspects ) of a reported delinquency and or derogatory condition be related to any alleged inquiry ( ies ) still yet unproven to hold the minimum mandatory document proof ( s ) thereby absolutely validating the physically verifiable written evidence of adequately achieved permissible purpose I demand that you immediately act to eradicate the accusations as unfounded and not currently compliant in its reporting, as is REQUIRED to report! Surely if unable to present undeniable physically verifiable proof of an items alleged delinquency ( ies ) and or derogatory ( ies ) as reported there exists ( LOGICALLY ) a concern and reasonable doubt as related to any linked allegation ( s ) of inquiry ( ies ) thereof as well! PLEASE WORK to Ensure the ethical, moral, adequately accurate, fully compliant reporting by your immediate willful modification ( s ) and or removals from reporting of any item or aspect of item ( s ), INCLUDING CLAIMS OF INQUIRY, that yet fail to meet the demonstrated requisites as mandatory, mentioned or not!

Notation : Please verify and validate all claims, every notation, dates and balances, whether reported or not. Remove immediately the unverified therefore invalidly reported CHARGE OFF claim. To date, no document proof of the physically verifiable validity of claim has been demonstrated nor offered. I am concerned with the reported data, please detail factually all aspects of claim, every notation, all dates and balances, source codes and personal identifiers, full 426-character P-segment with trailing factors, creditor classification code, XXXX, the 386-pieces to confirmate collection, and all requisite framents of reporting, mentioned or not.

Notation : Remove immediately the unverified therefore invalidly reported DEROGATORY CLAIM. The information reporting is one or more of being untrue, incorrect, incomplete, of not my ownership, of not my responsibility, not reported compliantly, or else wise is invalid deficient of physically verifiable document evidence of facts. Please verify and validate all claims, every notation, dates and balances, whether reported or not.

Notation : Remove immediately the unverified therefore invalidly reported claim that is significantly DEFICIENT REPORTED DATA. The information reporting is one or more of being untrue, incorrect, incomplete, of not my ownership, of not my responsibility, not reported compliantly, or else wise is invalid deficient of physically verifiable document evidence of facts. Please verify and validate all claims, every notation, dates and balances, whether reported or not. I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to- be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into a open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,301XX,,Consent provided,Web,11-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3148559

Upon examination of the report, I noticed that there were some inaccurate items that should not be there. 

After sending certified, return receipt letters on XX/XX/18 ( which were received on XX/XX/18 ), reporting that there were inaccuracies on my credit report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, account # : XXXX, claiming that I owe {$1200.00}, I requested that I would like some type of verification bearing my signature to verify the debt. I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. 

Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community. Since no verification of any kind has ever been sent to me or provided, I am seeking that this particular inaccurate claim is removed immediately.

The debt counseling agency has been helping me settle my debts and Wells Fargo credit card is one of the accounts. 

I also have a checking and savings account with Wells Fargo Bank. The debt counseling agency has been in communication with Wells Fargo over settling my credit card debt. 

I received a summons from an attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXdated XX/XX/XXXX This summons was given to Debt counseling agency and they are working with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo ignored the debt counseling agency 's negotiations and not willing to work with the debt counseling agency so in turn they garnished my ENTIRE paycheck including my wife 's. 

XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo garnished my ENTIRE paycheck and also my wife 's paycheck and left us with {$1000.00} to live on. I have a house mortgage, utilities, food that I am not able to meet to survive and now in financial hardship. They went into our checking account and savings account and took a total of {$2600.00} all in one chunk. Wells Fargo did not notify us that this will happen and ignored the debt counseling agency 's negotiation.. 

I am in utter emotional distress that Wells Fargo was able to do this when we are in a debt counseling agency and willing to pay Wells Fargo for my debt incurred. Wells Fargo jumped the gun, was greedy and just wanted to take the money without regard for the consumer and their personal living expenses. 

According to the garnishment law, they are suppose to only take no more than 25 % of the paycheck and not entitled to take the ENTIRE PAYCHECK and my wife 's too. Because we have a joint bank account they helped themselves and stole all our money. 

It is criminal Wells Fargo Bank would help themselves to our bank account. I will no longer bank with them since I know they are under criminal investigations for other bank fraud. I also checked my account and now they charged me for hidden charges which leaves my account at a negative balance.

I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me. I still went ahead and made the payment as shown on the receipt attached, however there still discrepancies shown on my credit report the way it's reporting such as with the wrong balance, wrong date of last activities, etc. There are several and multiple inaccuracies reporting on my credit report with this account. Due to these multiple violations on the way, it's reporting, I'm asking that this account be updated and paid as agreed never late or completely removed from my credit file.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",MA,023XX,,Consent provided,Web,07-01-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3118500
