10-03-2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I got a loan over 1 1/2 years ago. The loan was immediately bought by XXXX XXXX. At that time, I was not able to sell my other home and finally started leasing my previous home. The renters moved out before the end of the contract and left the home in a total mess. I was not able to get the home on the market until I had done some work on it. The home remained empty for 8 months before I could get it sold. Meanwhile, I was paying both mortgages along with electric and gas bills. I worked 2 jobs during that time to make sure I made the payments before the end of each month. The mortgage payments were made to Provident usually on the last week of the month but mostly on the last day of the month. Like I mentioned, I worked very hard to get both payments made before the end of each month. I was very concerned about my credit being affected. On 2 occasions, Provident reported my payment as late because it wasn't made by phone before the cut off time of XXXX XXXX. My other mortgage company had a cut of time of XXXX XXXX when I would call a payment in. They also accepted payments on XXXX and XXXX and credited the account on those days. This is not the case with Provident Funding. I had called their Customer Service at least 5 times during this period but they offered no options for me. As I said before, these payments to Provident were all made by phone on the last day of the month but still counted as late. This has greatly affected my credit rating with the 2 main reporting agencies. When I have called Provident, they connect me with Customer Service, I get the same answer that nothing can be done about the reported late payments. There are now a total of 3 late payments with no other late payments reported from other creditors. I had a good standing record with XXXX  XXXX XXXX prior to selling my previous home. Im asking Provident to please work with me as I am now aware of the cut off times for a payment. I worked very hard to pay all bills on time, even getting a second job. 
I was also told by the company who got me this loan that I would be able to set up a bi-weekly payment so the mortgage could be paid in 2 installments each month. When I called Provident, the customer service department told me they had no such service available.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,PROVIDENT FUNDING ASSOCIATES,OK,730XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,10-03-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3175180

I was instead automatically approved for an XXXX XXXX Visa Platinum plus card with a different annual fee and none of the benefits. Thinking this was a mistake, I applied again for the XXXX Visa Signature Card and the application went pending. I called BofA to see what was going on and they said they could approve me for the Visa Plat if i chose to. I chose not to but asked to have someone else look at my application for the Visa Signature card. He they asked if I consented to have my application reconsidered and i said yes. He then approved me for the other card, a Visa Platinum and claimed that I had never applied for the Visa Signature. I was escalated to a supervisor and she claimed my XXXX credit score and XXXX income did not qualify me for the Visa Signature and they decided to automatically approve me for a card that was not marketed at all on their application page. BAIT AND SWITCH. This is very deceptive. Definitely a UDAAP issue. I did some research online and there are HUNDREDS of other people who have complained about this same deceptive marketing practice. If you look at the link below, you will see advertising for ONLY the Visa Signature card and not the inferior yet still expensive Visa Platinum. There is no mention of the Platinum benefits or fees because they are inferior and nobody would apply knowing that they could be approved for the inferior card.

This Case was resolved because a review was completed of any and all eligible payments and my account was updated to reflect the correct number counting towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I was advised that number is one hundred and sixteen ( 116 ) eligible and qualifying monthly installments. I submitted a new Employer Certification Form ( ECF ) in XX/XX/XXXX and my payments XXXX  out on my online XXXX account. I made an additional payment for XX/XX/XXXX bringing my total potential eligible payments to 121. XXXX stated my eligible date of completion was XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted the Employer Certification Form and application for Public Service Loan Forgiveness as instructed by XXXX. I then received correspondence stating my application was rejected based on lack of qualifying payments. I began calling XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX about this issue. XXXX stated I lacked 5/6 qualifying payments. I reviewed my online account and it reflected 5/6 payments remaining. This was the same account that presently showed XXXX  before I sent my application in. I later checked the account again after seeking help from calling representatives with XXXX. My account now showed I had 57/63 remaining payments. I attempted to call on a weekly basis from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and was told the same thing numerous times. I was advised my account was under review and I would received an answer within 3/5 business days. I would call back after that time passed and was advised the review would take 6 months to a year. I was advised my several representatives and managers at XXXX that my payments could be seen as being paid on my account for the months of XXXX XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised these were the payments not being county as qualifying but my Employer Certification Form was approved and my payments are electronically debited for the amount I was instructed to pay. I was advised by XXXX that it was a computer glitch and I would have to request a payment review ( which I was advised that was happening when XXXX was 1st made away in XX/XX/XXXX ) and it would potentially take a year to review the remaining 5/6 payments. I am at a standstill with XXXX and I have provided everything they need but I keep getting a runaround and I feel I am being treated unfairly because I am trying to apply for loan forgiveness. I also was advised by XXXX that my application is on file and that I would not have to re-submit a new application. I do not feel this is accurate information because I am beginning not to trust anything that XXXX recommends because of the lack of effort and misinformation that I have received. I have attached the prior complaint and recent correspondence from XXXX. The newest correspondence shows that my payments were not counted from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, these are the payments that I was informed that should quality and put my account over or at 120 qualifying payments.",,AES/PHEAA,GA,,,Consent provided,Web,27-02-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3164248

She assured me if I made payments on time as scheduled that would not be a problem. I would never have agreed to such damage to my credit score for 3months of savings.

XXXX XXXX XXXX also known as XXXX XXXX ( account # XXXX ) was included in the bankruptcy. 

I currently have an auto loan and credit card with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX provides a credit monitoring service ( XXXX XXXX ) to it's member. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX informed me that my credit score was XXXX. 

Early XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alert from XXXX XXXX informing me that my credit score had dropped by 11 points. 

I immediately purchased membership to Experian ( $ XXXX/mo ), XXXX ( $ XXXX/mo ) and XXXX  ( $ XXXX/mo ) in order to investigate and dispute the matter. 

I found that XXXX XXXX XXXX also known as XXXX XXXX ( account # XXXX ) had reported payment status to all three credit bureaus which caused my credit score to plunge. 

I filed a dispute with all three credit bureaus. The results came back the same, XXXX XXXX XXXX also known as XXXX XXXX ( account # XXXX ) confirmed that this account was part of the bankruptcy and that they should not be reporting on this account. 

However, to date ( XX/XX/XXXX ), my credit score still has not  recovered. XXXX at the time XXXX/XXXX reported in XX/XX/XXXX, my score was XXXX. Today it is currently XXXX. Experian at the time XXXX/XXXX  reported in XX/XX/XXXX, my score was XXXX. Today it is currently XXXX. XXXX at the time XXXX/XXXX  reported in XX/XX/XXXX, my score was XXXX. Today it is currently XXXX. 

Today, as I prepared my evidence to upload, I noticed that the last date that XXXX/XXXX reported to XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX/XXXX is still reporting and ruining my life. The current Experian report does not reveal the last date reported. XXXX 's website is having technical difficulties so I was unable to retrieve a current report. 

My credit is damaged. I can't apply for many of the credit card offers that I have received since XX/XX/XXXX. I would like to change my residence. I would like to rent a single family home, but I would not qualify for the rental of a house, in an area of my liking, with this damaged credit.

15-07-2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Can't stop withdrawals from your account,"I deposited a check on XX/XX/19 in the amount of {$4900.00} and it cleared without issue. The bank can not reverse it at all. By law the checks take 2-3 days to clear. But on XX/XX/19 my account was in overdraft by that amount. My bank uncleared the check for no reason and without warning. I filed a complaint, tried to follow up with the bank, and the sender, and got no real answer. I have proof of the check clearing on XXXX in my statements, so I do not understand why this is happening to me. 

In a response from Wells Fargo they basically say nothing. Why did they clear the funds? And more importantly, once the check cleared it was my money and they can not confiscate this money without due process ( i.e., a court order ). Just saying the other bank asked for the money means nothing and it is my right to sue them for this. They are taking my money away without due course and I will be seeking legal remedy. 

Furthermore, I demand my money back. An explanation of what happened and why is not sufficient after this gross injustice. The whole point of having a bank account is knowing that my money is safe, not to wake up one day with an insufficient funds notice because one or more banks decided to unclear a check after three months. 

Additionally, on XX/XX/19 I was told by a customer service rep ( XXXX ) over the phone that the check would be returned to me because I hadn't endorsed it. I thought it was illegal to clear and unclear checks like this. They can not take away the money that belongs to me after funds are credited to my account- at that point that is my possession ). 

To conclude, Wells Fargo describing this happened does not clear the issue. They took my money away based on a no reason given issuer bank demand - that is ( at least to me ) a violation of Federal clearing laws - all check clearing related matters are governed by Regulation CC which prescribes the rules for this under the law : under Expeditious return of checks. ( which gives 2 business days to return a check ) and Notice of nonpayment ( which also asks for two days limit for such notice that notice can be via returned check, a writing ( including a copy of the check ), or telephone.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NJ,089XX,,Consent provided,Web,15-07-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3306169

XXXX Claims that they are servicing the debt for Bank of America ( B of A ) since XXXX. However, the servicing agreement between B of A and XXXX was executed on XXXX. Regardless, both B of A and XXXX claim to be collecting on the alleged debt owed. I have contacted both XXXX and B of A on numerous occasions and advised that I was never sued separately on the alleged deficiency balance due. The New Jersey law listed below was explained to both XXXX and B of A. It was ignored by both parties. The New Jersey law listed below clearly states a separate lawsuit must be filed in relation to the deficiency balance to be valid. 

Deficiency judgments are allowed in New Jersey, but not in the foreclosure action itself. To obtain a deficiency judgment, the lender must file a separate lawsuit within three months after the foreclosure sale or, if confirmation of the sale is required, from the date of the confirmation of the sale. ( N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:50-1 through 2A:50-2.1. ) The court may limit the amount of the deficiency judgment if the borrower disputes it. The borrower may dispute the amount of the deficiency by answering the lenders suit and introducing evidence regarding the propertys fair market value. The court will then limit the deficiency judgment amount to the difference between the debt and the fair market value as of the date of the foreclosure sale. ( N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:50-3. ) Neither XXXX nor B of A filed a separate lawsuit to bring the alleged debt to a valid status per NJ State law. This alleged should have been extinguished 3 months after the foreclosure sale date took place. However, both XXXX and B of A, have proceeded with aggressive collection activity and have reported the debt to my credit bureau report. XXXX and B or A are in violation of the FDCPA, FCRA and independent NJ State Laws. Since your agency regulates these laws, I am seeking your assistance on this matter.

I initially fell behind on payments ever since I moved to my new address. This was my responsibility and my fault here for not following up. 

In XXXX, I called the Wells Fargo Dealer Service multiple times in an attempt to pay off the debt. A settlement bill was scheduled to be sent a total of three times. The first did not arrive, the second arrived however it was burnt from our house fire. A third was send on the date extension XX/XX/18, with the due date XX/XX/18. The bill arrived afterwards, however an extension was not given. 
We attempted to pay at a local Wells Fargo to no avail. Email was unavailable to pay the bill. There is now a charge-off negative remark on my credit report. 

I would like to address this by paying the debt by the original {$290.00} payments on the Wells Fargo Dealer Services payment portal or get the negative remark removed from my credit report.

08-07-2019,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"SUBJECT : RETURN OF FUNDS FROM DOUBLE MORTAGE PAYMENT IN MONTH OF XXXX On or about XXXX XX/XX/2019 I authorized a monthly ACH draft from my XXXX XXXX checking account for the purpose of paying my mortgage to Freedom Mortgage. By XXXX XX/XX/2019 I had not received any form of written communication from Freedom Mortgage that verified the ACH draft would take effect. Therefore, on XXXX XX/XX/2019 I paid my mortgage payment via my on-line banking with XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XX/XX/2019 I finally received a letter ( dated XXXX XX/XX/2019 ) from Freedom Mortgage that stated my ACH draft request had been processed and that my XXXX checking would be debited on XXXX XX/XX/2019. I immediately called Freedom Mortgage and was told that it was impossible to stop the ACH draft on that day, and that I should attempt to stop the payment of the draft by my bank ( XXXX XXXX ). I called XXXX and asked that the draft not be honored. XXXX XXXX took all the pertinent information but stated that if the draft had already executed, it could not be stopped. And it was not stopped. 

Therefore, it is clear that I made two XXXX mortgage payments to my loan with Freedom Mortgage ; one was in error. I need one of those payments returned to my XXXX XXXX checking account. Both I and my wife are retirees and live on a very fixed income and budget. The {$2200.00} that made the second XXXX mortgage payment are the funds needed for our living expenses and other bills for the entire month of XXXX. 

After speaking to a Freedom Mortgage representative by phone on Friday, XXXX XX/XX/2019, I faxed to Freedom Mortgage the information above and a copy of my XXXX XXXX checking account information showing both payments had posted ( been paid ) to Freedom Mortgage. The Freedom Mortgage representative had provided me their fax # XXXX, which I used. On Monday, XXXX XX/XX/2019, I called Freedom Mortgage Customer Service # XXXX to inquire as to the status of my request for return of one of the two XXXX payments I made. I spoke with XXXX, id # XXXX, in XXXX, Indiana. I was first told that once the request had "" been processed '', a check would be sent to me. I asked why an electronic transfer could not be made directly to my checking account. I was put on hold for several minutes. I was then told that "" XXXX '' had told XXXX that once my fax "" had been found '', she would have an electronic transfer made to my XXXX XXXX Checking account, and that would take 5-7 days. I expressed my disbelief that an electronic transfer takes 5-7 days, and asked to speak with XXXX 's supervisor. I was again put on hold for several more minutes. I was then told a supervisor was not available I requested to make an appointment with a supervisor and that request was denied. The supervisor in question is "" XXXX '', also in XXXX, Indiana. In the final analysis, I received no confirmation that my fax had been located, nor that I would receive my funds any time soon.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Freedom Mortgage Company,VA,22191,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,08-07-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3298610

I called and spoke with an account supervisor named XXXX who said she doesnt know why I was charged that but couldnt refund me even though it was capital ones fault.

Charge reposted by Discover to my card apparently on XX/XX/18, I notice and message on XX/XX/18 requesting details. Apparently charge was upheld by vendor, so I assume the complete details not passed on to vendor. On XX/XX/18, Discover replies and informs me vendor upheld, but they will continue dispute. Repost of provisional credit was once again not applied until XX/XX/18. Apparently vendor upheld a second time ( despite vendor themselves investigating and admitting equipment malfunctioned and their accounting dept tells me to dispute the charge ) at which point Discover reposts twice on XX/XX/18, and they state it's because my credit card number changed mid-dispute. I explain they already reposted to the old card on XX/XX/18, and I can clearly see four debits and two credits on my account, resulting in me paying for the vendor 's charge and also paying Discover for it as well. Dispute escalation manager replied and indicated I must be confused because some were on my old card number and some on my new. I message a couple times to explain she is not accounting for all transactions in her summary of debits and credits, and they repeatedly argued, even though there is clear evidence in my transaction history. It is poor customer service to take weeks to reply to messages when it's stated at the bottom of the screen the customer can expect a reply within 24 hours. But it's absolutely inexcusable for the disputes department to manually adjust an account and not take seriously a customer 's complaint despite evidence to the contrary. They eventually credited back twice, which resulted in eight total debits and credits. They never explained why they credited twice, if the vendor eventually validated my dispute or if Discover credited due to my complaint. However, my balance does not reflect that as it should be a net XXXX. Once the credits were posted on XX/XX/18, it should have resulted in a wash.

They had nothing to show me that could verify I owe anything. After a bit of research, it was determined that this does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation. This inaccurate, incomplete document contains no accounting of any payments made nor missed, nor the dates on which those payments were made or missed. There isnt even any documentation with my signature on it that proves this is even my account at all. This information could have easily been drawn up and sent by anyone or simply created in human error. Their verification document in no way provides sufficient verification of this alleged debt. There isnt any legitimate, verifiable proof that I owe anything to their Company, because I dont. 

This collection on my credit reports are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ XXXX. You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} FCRA violation fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. 

I intend to follow through with the suit if this is not deleted from my account within 15 days.

Experian recklessly ignores the real issue and ignores my factual evidences and instead lecture the reader here instead of honest response to the real facts of the complaint. Thus, Experian must comply to the law or face it. If Experian can prove that I never had automatic payment or that I canceled it or block it or my bank canceled it or block then the collection account that alleged {$1300.00} should remain and if they can not which is a fact then Experian must deleted the only negative information or the collection about the XXXX alleged owed amount of $ XXXX.because my bank write a letter and confirmed that I never called my bank to cancel that automatic and I never canceled that automoatic payment and my account that provide funds to that automatic payment is same and open and has always funds of over 4000 $ daily and if XXXX wanted to get paid for any amount they have the ability to do so and they must stop harrassing me and damaging my financial reputation. I challenged Experian and its collection agency to prove me and my bank wrong about the fact that I and my bank did not impede XXXX to do what it was used to do using the automatic payment and get paid for any ligitimate amount proven I owed them but instead they use this collection over and over and drag me to complain and dispute it maybe they think I will give up my rights but they must know they have to follow role of law. Experian must comply to FCRA and my Virginia state law and delete that unlawful collection with original creditor XXXX because it is about the same amount previously disputed with this bureau and it was deleted and why is not the case now?

This was a long, tedious process but it was finally accomplished. With XXXX I had no trouble lifting the freeze. However, I am finding that trying to unfreeze the accounts through XXXX and Equifax has been not only hard but nearly impossible. I was given pin # s to use by XXXX and XXXX but NOT by Equifax when I was ready to lift the freeze. 

I have tried repeatedly to have my security freeze permanently removed from XXXX, using the pin # they sent me but it keeps giving me a security freeze error and then recommends that I call them at XXXX. This automated system does not give you the option of removing a freeze, only of placing a freeze or fraud alert and there is no capability of talking to a live person. I have also tried their site at experian.com/upload but keep getting the message that the documents are not loading. Although sending my information online has it's risks, I feel like sending all of my information through the mail feels like an even riskier option. 

As for Equifax, I do not know how to proceed since I can not find any paperwork they sent to me with a pin #, like the other two did. 

I would greatly appreciate your help with this problem.

The job was financial related and required a good credit report. Two weeks later I was denied housing because the company stated my credit report showed debt to another housing provider. I pulled my Equifax credit report and discovered an inordinate amount of errors. There were over 50 errors total on my report. I sent them a letter immediately explaining and showing in detail why each item was an error and asked them to investigate and resolve. In XXXX they sent me back a letter saying that they had completed an investigation and verified all information. It was a very blanket letter not outlining how they conducted any investigation. I then sent them a response showing that these were in fact errors and should be either updated or deleted ( based upon each individual line item 's situation ). The response I received was almost an identical letter to the first one they sent. It did not address any of the my concerns at all. Overall I have repeatedly contacted this company in hopes that they would resolve these errors and they have not. Ive sent letters in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX immediately upon receiving their repossess and have receipts of certified my mail being received by them each time. To date I am still unable to secure housing or a suitable job because of these errors. I. work in finance and can not afford to have such errors on my report. In addition to all of the negative errors I also discovered thatchy are not reporting at all on many of my positive credit lines. I have contacted my credit card companies to confirm that they report to the bureaus nd each confirmed that indeed they do report. Therefore there is no sufficient reason why my positive credit lines are not reported and thus why all of these erroneous negative items are reported. I am in a world of trouble because of this negligence and they just keep sending back the same letter saying they verified the items. There is no way to verify something that never happened. When I asked for proof of these items belonging to me in the form of anything I authorized or signed or even recordings where I gave approval I received nothing repeatedly. Please help me.

16-07-2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,Originally my loan was with XXXX. I lost my job and asked for a loan modification. I went to consumer credit counseling for help. XXXX had so many modification applications at the time they had outsourced some of their work. Anyway they mislabeled my loan lost my loan application and this continued for a couple of years. Instead of a modification they started foreclosure proceedings. I ended up filing bankruptcy. My mortgage was included. Then after a few years of paying my bankruptcy payments XXXX wanted the amount increased. I was paying XXXX a month they wanted XXXX a month I could not pay that amount so my case was dismissed. I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX to get this done. We called several times a month before the bankruptcy and after the bankruptcy was dismissed. They finally came back with XXXX left on my principal balance and were supposed to be doing a modification. In the meantime I received a letter from Shellpoint mortgage saying they were servicing my loan and it was XXXX. We called XXXX and they told us that my loan had not been sold or transferred and that they were still working on a modification. Well it had been sold and Shellpoint had started foreclosure proceedings. I called them and told them what happened and I contacted my attorney to file bankruptcy again. But they stopped the foreclosure and agreed to do a modification. I did the trial period and the paperwork came back with my principal balance being XXXX. I disputed the amount of my principal balance. They told me if I didnt sign the modification that I would immediately go into foreclosure. I said I would sign the paperwork to avoid foreclosure but I disputed the charges. I contacted the Alabama attorney generals office for help. Shellpoint told them that the charges were from the missed payments from when XXXX had my loan. I explained to Shellpoint that XXXX agreed that all I owed was XXXX and they were supposed to do the modification which Shellpoint was fully aware of anyway. My first paper statement from Shellpoint reflects my principal balance being XXXX. They still refuse to remove the charges of over XXXX making what I owe more than my original loan and have sold my mortgage to XXXX mortgage servicing. Also when I called Shellpoint to tell them that making the payments on the first of the month might be a problem their agent told me that Shellpoint doesnt consider a payment late if its made in the month its due. They sent me a nasty letter threatening foreclosure even though I was never behind and added late payment fees to every payment. But that didnt happen until I sent them messages requesting the other fraudulent charges be removed.,Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",AL,,,Consent provided,Web,16-07-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3308494

Be advised that the Holder Rule protects consumers claims & defenses against a creditor or assignee 16 C.F.R. 433.

The advisory opinion goes on to state that the Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA addresses the duty to correct and update information by furnishers, or persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRA ) such as credit bureaus. In particular, this section requires a person that has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide any information needed to make it complete and accurate. Thus, on its face, this provision requires a furnisher to provide corrected or updated information to the consumer reporting agency that it had reported to originally. This duty extends to student loan accounts reported to CRAs, regardless of whether they were accurate at one point, because the section requires the furnisher both to update accounts as well as to correct even if the loan was correctly reported as delinquent, but has subsequently been paid.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,,,Consent provided,Web,23-12-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3108091

30-12-2018,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"On XX/XX/XXXX I tried to make a payment on my mortgage. My mortgage was previously serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Carrington Mortgage services is now the servicer. The terms in which my payments are processed have changed dramatically. I have to pay fees to make payments which I did not have to do before, my payments have gone up again which did not happen before, and then if I fall behind which in my almost 10 years of paying on my mortgage has happened, life happens. When I try to make my payments Carrington shuts down avenues to make them. If I am in the 30 day late category they refuse online payments and refuse over the phone payments. I spoke at length with two representatives from Carrington Mortgage Services on XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised that they will take my payment from through XXXX XXXX at an additional {$8.00} charge because they were refusing my online payment and would apply it by the end of business. I made XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX XXXX I paid more than enough to cover the late fees. That brings me less than 30 days past due. I was assured they would apply the payment and that they process payments on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX as well. Either way my payment was made before 3pm that Friday. I checked my Carrington online account and it is still not posted. This is not the first time Carrington had refused payments. I was only 1 month behind and I pay my penalty. You have people who serve their time in prison for crimes. I had an issue that arose and paid my late fee. For them to continue to penalize me and refuse my payments or not apply my payments which is the case here I feel is unacceptable. As of writing this I am officially less than 30 days past due and should be cleared on any default on my loan. I am fine with a new servicer on my loan, however I am quite offended and frustrated that I feel Carrington is not servicing my loan in the same manner it was being serviced for the almost 10 years I have had my loan. I have not signed any paperwork or agreed to any additional fees and I feel they are playing deceptive games by refusing to apply payments to try to send my loan to foreclosure. My servicer should be the one per my understanding of the law to try to help with foreclosure avoidance and refusing to apply full monthly payments, especially when such payment brings my loan back into the less than 30 days past due status I feel is fraudulent activity and I am requesting they cease and desist these perceived fraudulent activities immediately and apply any and all payments to my account and fix any damages to my credit report. I am also requesting that they go back and fix my credit for the last time they held almost 3 months of my payments in a suspense account and refused to release the payments and during that time reported negatively on my credit report.",,"CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC",CA,925XX,,Consent provided,Web,30-12-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3112850

On my XX/XX/XXXX statement, I was told to pay a partial payment of my usual monthly mortgage. My usual payment is {$1400.00} per month. My XXXX statement said to pay {$370.00}, as a {$1000.00} payment had already been applied. I paid {$400.00} for my XXXX statement. I soon received a letter informing me I did not pay my XXXX balance. By XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter saying I owed {$2500.00} because I didn't pay the whole balance due in XXXX. So I had to take a loan from my parents to cover this cost. I paid this total amount then on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called XXXX and asked about the discrepancy in the XXXX statement, they were not sure why the problem happened and they would get back to me. They did not. When I called back around XX/XX/XXXX, the service agents couldn't explain why there was a {$1000.00} payment made to my account, and later retracted. When this payment was retracted that caused my partial payment to not meet the monthly cost and I was sent a failure to pay notice. At this point XXXX told me it was going to be ok.

I went to the bank and and they organised this change in status and switched all of my accounts over accordingly ( that included my going from an entry level checking account to an account which has no fees as long as there is a minimum high balance or other qualifying events associated with my accounts which this large deposit suddenly made me eligible for ). Several months later I decided to move most of my money to retirement investments and around six months after I qualified for the Private Client status, I received another phone call to tell me I was disqualified from Chase Private Client for not having a high enough balance in my Chase accounts. I had to return to the bank and have my accounts switched back to regular accounts becasue my low income and savings meant my minimum balances would generate fees. This was all taken care of by the person who was managing my Chase Private Client status. I have since had to purchase check books and so on for this account as anyone would with a regular account. Given my salary and savings, and after transferring my funds into my retirement, if I were to walk into the bank I would not qualify for this account. 

I did not realise, until today, that the bank for some reason did not change my checking account back to a regular entry level account when they took away the private client status and changed my savings account. I have been charged $ XXXX/month for my checking account becasue they funds have been under the minimum $ XXXX. I had no idea that they skipped changing my checking account when they changed my savings and happily took me out of their program ( for which I stopped receiving any benefits from back when I lost the status - i.e no free check books etc ). I called chase and they offered to refund 2 of the payments. I believe the bank should refund all of the payments of {$25.00} they have removed from my checking account since they made the error back in late XXXX. They said I should have read the fine print on every monthly statement becasue the conditions of my account are written in there. I was led to believe I had been switched back to my regular entry level account that I had before they changed it. 

I would like to initiate a claim for these {$25.00} payments. I believe the bank made a error and are are trying to mislead me into thinking it was my fault by trying to blame me using the "" read the fine print '' line.

In XX/XX/XXXX I sold a truck which had a $ XXXXpayment and in XX/XX/XXXX my wifes car w/ a $ XXXX/payment will be paid off. During XXXX we had some insufficient funds transactions that resulted in ACH missed payments. The relationship between Citizens and XXXX was always confused. There were times when I would return a call from Citizens & or XXXX to make a payment after a missed ACH and they would tell me the loan was current. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I called Citizens Bank/XXXX & spk w/ XXXX XXXX to make a payment and start the process of getting caught up. She advised me the account had charged off and I need to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX. I advised I was not comfortable dealing w/ a third-party debt collector and wish to pay Citizens bank directly she couldnt accept my payment. She stated the loan was charge off on XX/XX/XXXX by Citizens and that was early because the loan had not yet reach 120 days past due, and she suggested that we bring on XXXX. I agreed and she joined XXXX/XXXX ph # XXXX, who said the charge off was authorized by Citizens bank on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX officially sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that I needed to speak w/ them. I again expressed that I wasnt comfortable dealing w/ a third-party collection agency, but still XXXX couldnt help me. She did say another collections department at Citizens may be of assistance at XXXX. I then asked to speak w/ a manager at Citizens bank and XXXX brought on Manager XXXX , but he refused my payment, I asked for his supervisor and was told that person couldnt come to the phone, but they could have them call me w/ in 72 hours. I have received no return call as of XX/XX/XXXX. To all three individuals I expressed all of the above of about freeing up cash flow and I was prepared to bring this loan current in short order and honor the term of the original loan and that my loan be reinstated as only 7 days had passed since the charge, again XXXX refused my payment and told me I had to deal w/ XXXX XXXX XXXX ph # XXXX and that Citizens nor XXXX could assist me further. I then called XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the representative stated I needed to settle the $ XXXX balance w/ them and suggested that I settle for an immediate {$12000.00} payment. I advised I couldnt pay that and wouldnt be doing so soon, the representative chuckled and said well that might be your opinion. I advised I wanted to deal directly w/ Citizens bank and the representative hung up on me. I called Back Citizens directly/XXXX spk w/ various managers advising I was not comfortable dealing w/ their 3rd party debt collector/suto law office and explained the immediate demand and the hang up. Citizen refused to help me and told me I need to deal w/ XXXX . I am ready to make payments to them immediately and bring my account current quickly ( I have advised them of this ). On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I called back Citizen bank again requesting to speak w/ a manager. I inquired about the 72-hour manager call back and they couldnt speak to that return call. I asked again for consideration on accepting my payments, but they again refused. I then requested a pay history since loan inception. They advised I needed to contact XXXX for the pay history online. I made the request with XXXX & have not received it. I am requesting Citizens bank reinstate my loan and I will catch up on pass due payments in the next 45days and ensure all future payments are made on time. I think Citizens being a very large institution can work w/ me here, especially since when I was advised of the action the XXXXhird party had only been engaged in the prior seven days and that over the course of the loan there were times I could have made payments after a missed ACH but was told by either Citizens or XXXX that I was not overdue and didnt need to make a payment.

Even with the sharp decline in property values in XXXX, in the intervening 10-year period the property has never appraised for more that {$350000.00} through at least 3 other independent appraisers. Consequently, we can not refinance the house through any alternative lender ( even through the VA ) since, after making payments for over 13 years, the outstanding balance is {$370000.00} and at an exorbitant interest rate of 6.875 %. We have contacted Wells Fargo two ( 2 ) times requesting a refinance ( combining both the {$300000.00} primary and {$71000.00} second into a single 15-year mortgage or simply refinancing the first at a lower rate ) but, they are unwilling to make any changes or amendments. We are of the belief that Wells Fargo artificially inflated the appraisal in XXXX and now, through interest rates that are double the current rate and due to a fraudulent appraisal, they are unwilling to provided us with any recourse or alternative due to their deceptive lending practices. Additionally, these practices and timelines are perfectly consistent with the issues surrounding a {$2.00} XXXX fine wherein Wells Fargo artificially inflated applicant 's incomes ( they must have inflated ours to qualify for the fraudulently inflated appraisal amount ) and XXXX XXXX fine from you and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( wherein Wells Fargo inflated the appraisal in order to collect additional fees based upon the higher property value ).
